OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between initiating therapy with an 
antipsychotic medication and a subsequent new diagnosis of a drug-induced 
movement disorder other than parkinsonism in older adults with dementia.
DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based cohort study.
SETTING: Ontario, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Ontario residents aged 66 and older with a diagnosis of dementia 
newly started on treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotic therapy.
MEASUREMENT: Estimated relative risk of developing a drug-induced movement other 
than parkinsonism in the 1-year follow-up period after starting therapy with an 
antipsychotic medication.
RESULTS: From April 1, 1997, to March 31, 2001, 21, 835 older adults with 
dementia who were newly started on antipsychotic medications were identified. 
Nine thousand seven hundred ninety subjects were started on atypical 
antipsychotics and 12,045 subjects started on typical antipsychotics. 
Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. There were 5.24 
cases of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or other drug-induced movement disorder per 100 
person-years on therapy with a typical antipsychotic and 5.19 cases per 100 
person-years on therapy with an atypical antipsychotic. The risk of developing 
drug-induced movement disorder while being treated with an atypical agent was 
not statistically different from that with a typical antipsychotic (relative 
risk=0.99, 95% confidence interval=0.86-1.15; P<.93).
CONCLUSION: Older adults with dementia who are treated with typical or atypical 
antipsychotic therapy are at risk for developing TD and other drug-induced 
movement disorders.

Firing rates of pallidal neurons are similar in Huntington's and Parkinson's 
disease patients.

According to the now classical basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry model, 
the chorea of Huntington's disease (HD) and the hypokinesia in Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are explained by a decrease in the inhibitory output (reduced 
firing rates) from the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in HD and increased output 
in PD. Differences between firing patterns might also be a factor contributing 
to the different symptoms, however. To test the predictions of the model we 
examined neuronal firing rates and patterns in two HD patients and 14 PD 
patients. Single-cell, microelectrode recordings were obtained from awake 
patients undergoing stereotactic surgery for implantation of deep brain 
stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the GPi. The mean neuronal firing rate in the 
GPi of HD patients was 81.8+/-4.3 Hz (mean+/-SEM), which was not significantly 
different from that in PD patients (89.9+/-3.0 Hz). Firing pattern analyses 
using measurements of burst index, coefficient of variation, and percentage 
participation of spikes in bursts revealed, however, that GPi neurons in HD 
patients fired in a more regular pattern (fewer "bursts") than in PD patients. 
These results suggest that the rate-based model does not adequately explain the 
motor abnormalities present in the two HD patients studied. Furthermore, the 
findings did reveal a difference between firing patterns in the HD and PD 
groups, thereby supporting the role of altered firing patterns in the 
pathophysiology of these diseases.

Study.

Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Most prognostic studies on Parkinson disease have been hospital 
based or have applied register-based case-finding methods. Potential 
under-representation of mild cases may have given biased results.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Parkinson disease is associated with an increased 
risk of dementia and death.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. Parkinson disease and dementia were 
assessed through in-person examination at baseline (1990-1993) and 2 follow-up 
visits (1993-1994 and 1997-1999). Computerized linkage to medical and 
municipality records provided additional information on disease outcomes and 
mortality.
SETTING: General population.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6969 participants, including 99 prevalent and 67 
incident cases of Parkinson disease.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident dementia and death. Adjusted hazard ratios were 
calculated through Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with Parkinson disease had an increased risk of dementia 
(hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.4), which was especially 
pronounced in participants carrying at least 1 apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) 
epsilon2 allele (13.5; 4.5-40.6). Parkinson disease was associated with an 
increased mortality risk (1.8; 1.5-2.3). The association consistently diminished 
when analyses were sequentially restricted to patients with shorter disease 
duration and after adjustment for the occurrence of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Especially patients with Parkinson disease who carry an APOE 
epsilon2 allele have an increased risk of developing dementia. Increased 
mortality risk in Parkinson disease is dependent on disease duration and is only 
modest in the absence of dementia.

Tau gene mutations and their effects.

Tau is the major component of the intracellular filamentous deposits that define 
a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including the largely sporadic 
Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, 
Pick's disease, and argyrophilic grain disease, as well as the inherited 
frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). For 
a long time, it was unclear whether the dysfunction of tau protein follows 
disease or whether disease follows the dysfunction of tau protein. The 
identification of mutations in Tau as the cause of FTDP-17 has resolved this 
issue. About half of the known mutations have their primary effect at the 
protein level, and they reduce the ability of tau protein to interact with 
microtubules and increase its propensity to assemble into abnormal filaments. 
The other mutations have their primary effect at the RNA level, thus perturbing 
the normal ratio of three-repeat to four-repeat tau isoforms. Where studied, 
this resulted in the relative overproduction of tau protein with four 
microtubule-binding repeats in brain. Several Tau mutations give rise to 
diseases that resemble progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal 
degeneration, or Pick's disease. Moreover, the H1 haplotype of Tau has been 
identified as a significant risk factor for progressive supranuclear palsy and 
corticobasal degeneration.

Role of hypokinesia and bradykinesia in gait disturbances in Huntington's 
disease: a biomechanical study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate specific patterns of locomotion in Huntington's disease 
(HD) and notably the respective roles of hypokinesia (i. e. a decrease in the 
amplitude of movement) and bradykinesia (i. e. difficulty in executing a 
movement, slowness) in gait disturbance.
METHODS: Kinematic, spatial (stride length, speed), temporal (cadence, speed, 
and stride time) and angular gait parameters (joint ankle range) were recorded 
in 15 early-stage HD patients by means of a video motion analysis system and 
then compared with 15 controls and 15 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
Hypokinesia was studied in terms of both spatial (decrease in stride length) and 
angular gait parameters (decrease in joint ankle range), whereas hyperkinesia 
was characterized by an increase in joint ankle range. Bradykinesia (defined by 
a decrease in gait velocity) was also assessed in terms of temporal parameters 
(cadence, stride time). We studied the influence of clinical symptoms (motor 
dysfunction, chorea, overall disability and cognitive impairment) and the CAG 
repeat number on gait abnormalities.
RESULTS: we observed a clear decrease in gait speed, a decrease in cadence and 
an increase in stride time (i. e. bradykinesia) for HD, with significant 
intra-individual variability. Cadence remained normal in PD. In HD, there was no 
evidence for a clear decrease in stride length, although the latter is a 
characteristic feature of hypokinetic gait (such as that observed in PD). Angle 
analysis revealed the coexistence of hyperkinesia and hypokinesia in HD, which 
thus participate in gait abnormalities. Gait speed in HD was correlated to the 
motor part of the UHDRS.
CONCLUSION: Gait in HD is mainly characterized by a timing disorder: 
bradykinesia was present, with severe intra-individual variability in temporal 
gait parameters.

Although mild cognitive impairment and dementia are common and have important 
clinical consequences for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their 
caregivers, it is still unclear whether cognitive symptoms may predict the 
development of dementia in PD patients. The objective of this study was to 
determine whether cognitive deficits in nondemented PD patients predicted the 
development of dementia 4 years later. A total of 76 nondemented PD patients 
from an epidemiological study of PD in the county of Rogaland, Norway, were 
assessed at baseline and 4 years later with neurological, psychiatric, and 
neuropsychological evaluations. Twenty-five (42%) new cases of dementia were 
diagnosed after 4 years. Time to complete the third card of the Stroop test was 
the only variable that was independently associated with dementia. The authors 
concluded that poor performance on a test sensitive to executive dysfunction 
predicted later development of dementia in PD patients. This finding may have 
important clinical implications as a marker of subsequent development of 
dementia.

Mutations in the leucine-rich kinase 2 gene (LRRK 2) encoding dardarin, on 
chromosome 12, are a common cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. 
The most common mutation, a heterozygous 6055 G>A transition (G 2019 S) accounts 
for approximately 3--10% of familial Parkinson's disease and 1--8% sporadic 
Parkinson's disease in several European-derived populations. Some families with 
disease caused by LRRK 2 mutations have been reported to include patients with 
highly variable clinical and pathological features. We screened for the most 
common LRRK 2 mutation in a series of patients with Parkinson's Disease, 
Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System Atrophy and 
frontotemporal dementia, as well as in neurologically normal controls. The 
mutation was found only in Parkinson's disease patients or their relatives and 
not in those with other neurodegenerative disease.

Andrade Marín, Quito - Ecuador. serranom@pi.pro.ec

OBJECTIVE: To assess the significance of delirium in parkinsonian patients in a 
5-year follow-up case-control study with three groups of patients: Parkinsonian 
and Delirium (PDG), Parkinsonian (PG) and Control (CG).
METHODS: Comparisons of Short Test of Mental Status (STMS) and Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-motor section (UPDRS(m)) between groups were 
performed using analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Comparisons of 
survival functions and Cox regression models were used to analyse the time until 
death.
RESULTS: STMS and UPDRS(m) mean scores were statistically different between PDG 
group and the other two groups (p < 0.001) and between PDG and PG groups (p < 
0.001), respectively. Including all groups, PG's patients (HR = 0.29; 95% C.I. = 
0.09-0.93) and CG's patients (HR = 0.13; 95% C.I. = 0.03-0.60) had less hazard 
to die than PDG's patients; patients with a STMS basal score >33 (HR = 0.37; 95% 
C.I. = 0.13-0.99) had less hazard to die than patients with a score < or =33. 
Finally, including PDG and PG groups, patients with basal UPDRS(m) score >17 (HR 
= 4.88; 95% C.I. = 1.11-21.48) had higher hazard to die than patients with a 
score < or =17.
CONCLUSION: For patients with Parkinson's, delirium is an increased risk factor 
for developing dementia, to have a more severe motor impairment and to death.

Increased rates of brain atrophy are seen in Alzheimer's disease, but whether 
rates are similarly increased in other dementias such as Parkinson's disease 
dementia (PDD) has not been well examined. We determined the rates of brain 
atrophy using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PDD and compared this 
finding to rates seen in cognitively intact Parkinson's disease (PD) patients 
and age-matched control subjects. Thirty-one patients (PD = 18, PDD = 13) and 24 
age-matched controls underwent serial volumetric 1.5 T MRI scans, approximately 
1 year apart. Baseline and repeat scans were registered and quantification of 
the brain boundary shift integral was used to determine whole-brain atrophy 
rates. Rates of brain atrophy were significantly increased in PDD (1.12 +/- 
0.98%/year) compared to PD (0.31 +/- 0.69%/year; P = 0.018) and control subjects 
(0.34 +/- 0.76%/year; P = 0.015). There were no differences in atrophy rates 
between controls and PD (P = 0.79). No correlations between increased atrophy 
rates and age or dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination score) were 
observed. Serial MRI may be a useful tool for monitoring disease progression in 
PDD and further studies should investigate its utility for early diagnosis.

Presence of an APOE4 allele results in significantly earlier onset of 
Parkinson's disease and a higher risk with dementia.

The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) has been consistently 
associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as an earlier 
onset of AD. It is possible that APOE4 may also play a role in the etiology of 
other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). APOE 
genotype, age of onset, disease duration, smoking history, and dementia status 
were collected for families with PD, yielding 324 Caucasian families with 
complete information. Logistic regression employing one individual per family 
and including age of onset and disease duration as covariates demonstrated a 
significantly increased risk of dementia for those individuals having inherited 
at least one epsilon4 allele (OR=3.37; P=0.002). Survival analyses also 
demonstrated a significantly earlier age of onset for those subjects with at 
least one epsilon4 allele (59.7 years) as compared with those homozygous for the 
more common epsilon3 allele (62.4 years; P=0.009). Thus, consistent with 
previous studies, we find evidence that the presence of an epsilon4 allele 
results in significantly earlier onset of PD and a greater likelihood of 
dementia. It appears the similarities between PD and AD may be due to an overlap 
in the diseases' genetic etiology.

We examined the objective diagnosis of dementia based on changes in the corpus 
callosum. We examined midsagittal head MR images of 17 early dementia patients 
(2 men and 15 women; mean age, 77.2+/-3.3 years) and 18 healthy elderly controls 
(2 men and 16 women; mean age, 73.8+/-6.5 years), 35 subjects altogether. First, 
the corpus callosum was automatically extracted from the MR images. Next, early 
dementia was compared with the healthy elderly individuals using 5 features of 
the straight-line methods, 5 features of the Run-Length Matrix, and 6 features 
of the Co-occurrence Matrix from the corpus callosum. Automatic extraction of 
the corpus callosum showed an accuracy rate of 84.1+/-3.7%. A statistically 
significant difference was found in 6 of the 16 features between early dementia 
patients and healthy elderly controls. Discriminant analysis using the 6 
features demonstrated a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 77.8%, with an 
overall accuracy of 82.9%. These results indicate that feature analysis based on 
changes in the corpus callosum can be used as an objective diagnostic technique 
for early dementia.

Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (AD), the two most common 
neurodegenerative disorders in American adults, are of purely genetic origin in 
a minority of cases and appear in most instances to arise through interactions 
among genetic and environmental factors. In this article we hypothesize that 
environmental exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance 
and review evidence for the early environmental origins of neurodegeneration. 
For PD the first recognized environmental cause, MPTP 
(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), was identified in epidemiologic 
studies of drug abusers. Chemicals experimentally linked to PD include the 
insecticide rotenone and the herbicides paraquat and maneb; interaction has been 
observed between paraquat and maneb. In epidemiologic studies, manganese has 
been linked to parkinsonism. In dementia, lead is associated with increased risk 
in chronically exposed workers. Exposures of children in early life to lead, 
polychlorinated biphenyls, and methylmercury have been followed by persistent 
decrements in intelligence that may presage dementia. To discover new 
environmental causes of AD and PD, and to characterize relevant gene-environment 
interactions, we recommend that a large, prospective genetic and epidemiologic 
study be undertaken that will follow thousands of children from conception (or 
before) to old age. Additional approaches to etiologic discovery include 
establishing incidence registries for AD and PD, conducting targeted 
investigations in high-risk populations, and improving testing of the potential 
neurologic toxicity of chemicals.

Evidence of oxidative stress in the neocortex in incidental Lewy body disease.

Universitari de Bellvitge, Spain.

Oxidative stress has been well documented in the substantia nigra in Parkinson 
disease (PD), but little is known about oxidative damage, particularly 
lipoxidation, advanced glycation (AGE), and AGE receptors (RAGE) in other 
structures, including the cerebral cortex, in early stages of diseases with Lewy 
bodies. The present study was undertaken to analyze these parameters in the 
frontal cortex (area 8), amygdala, and substantia nigra in selected cases with 
no neurologic symptoms and with neuropathologically verified incidental Lewy 
body disease-related changes, comparing them with healthy age-matched 
individuals. Results of the present study have shown mass spectrometric and 
immunologic evidences of increased lipoxidative damage by the markers 
malondialdehyde-lysine (MDAL) and 4-hydroxynonenal-lysine (HNE), increased 
expression of AGE in the substantia nigra, amygdala, and frontal cortex, and 
increased and heterogeneous RAGE cellular expression in the substantia nigra and 
frontal cortex in cases with early stages of parkinsonian neuropathology. In 
addition, increased content of the highly peroxidizable docosahexaenoic acid in 
the amygdala and frontal cortex. These changes were not associated to 
alpha-synuclein aggregation in cortex, contrasting with aggregates found in 
SDS-soluble fractions of frontal cortex in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
cases. The pattern of lipidic abnormalities differed in DLB and incidental Lewy 
body disease. Furthermore, although AGE and RAGE expression were raised in DLB, 
no increase in the total amount of HNE and MDAL adducts was found in the 
cerebral cortex in DLB. Preliminary analyses have identified 2 proteins with 
lipoxidative damage, alpha-synuclein and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), 
in incidentally Lewy body disease cortex. This study demonstrates abnormal fatty 
acid profiles, increased and selective lipoxidative damage, and increased AGE 
and RAGE expression in the frontal cortex in cases with early stages of 
parkinsonian neuropathology without treatment. These findings further support 
antioxidant therapy in the treatment of PD to reduce cortical damage associated 
with oxidative stress.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the burden of pressure ulcer-associated mortality in 
the United States and to examine racial/ethnic differences and associated 
comorbidities.
DESIGN: A descriptive study with matched odds ratio comparisons.
SETTING: The United States, 1990-2001.
PARTICIPANTS: Pressure ulcer-associated deaths were identified from national 
multiple cause-coded death records from 1990 to 2001.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-adjusted mortality rates and matched odds ratio 
comparisons of pressure ulcer-associated deaths with deaths from other 
conditions.
MAIN RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2001, pressure ulcers were reported as a cause of 
death among 114,380 persons (age-adjusted mortality rate, 3.79 per 100,000 
population; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.77-3.81). For 21,365 (18.7%) of 
these deaths, pressure ulcers were reported as the underlying cause. Nearly 80% 
of pressure ulcer-associated deaths occurred in persons at least 75 years old. 
Septicemia was reported in 39.7% of pressure ulcer-associated deaths (matched 
odds ratio, 11.3; 95% CI, 11.0-11.7). Multiple sclerosis, paralysis, Alzheimer 
disease, osteoporosis, and Parkinson disease were reported more often in 
pressure ulcer-associated deaths than in matched controls. Pressure 
ulcer-associated mortality was higher among blacks than among whites 
(age-adjusted rate ratio, 4.22; 95% CI, 4.16-4.27).
CONCLUSION: Pressure ulcers are associated with fatal septic infections and are 
reported as a cause of thousands of deaths each year in the United States. 
Incapacitating chronic and neurodegenerative conditions are common 
comorbidities, and mortality rates in blacks are higher than in other 
racial/ethnic groups.

Dementia is a common complication of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the cause is 
incompletely understood. In previous studies, dementia has been associated with 
an increase in hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter. The aim of 
this study was to explore whether white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on 
cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are associated with dementia in PD. 
For this study, 35 patients with PD, 16 with dementia (PDD) and 19 without 
(PDND), and 20 control subjects were recruited. MRI scans of patients and 
controls were rated for WMH, blind to diagnosis, using the Scheltens visual 
rating scale. Both bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were carried 
out. Cerebrovascular risk factors, education, gender, or age were similar across 
groups. Compared with the PDND group, the PDD group had significantly higher 
level of WMH in the deep white matter and in the periventricular areas. WMH in 
the deep white matter was the only variable that was associated significantly 
with Mini-Mental State Examination score and explained 38% of the variance in 
the multivariate linear regression analysis. Our findings suggest that WMH in 
the deep white matter may contribute to dementia in PD.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and 
poses considerable health challenges to both patients and their families. 
Rivastigmine is a powerful slow-reversible, noncompetitive carbamate 
cholinesterase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate 
Alzheimer's disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up 
to 6 months duration have shown beneficial effects of rivastigmine compared with 
placebo in measures of cognition and global functioning. Less rigorous but 
growing data suggest that the beneficial effects may endure for up to 5 years, 
extend to more advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and may occur in 
noncognitive domains, such as activities of daily living and the behavioral 
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence from controlled studies also supports 
the use of rivastigmine for cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's 
disease associated with vascular risk factors, dementia with Lewy bodies and 
Parkinson's disease dementia. Early and continued treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease with rivastigmine maximizes the observed beneficial effects. The most 
prominent adverse effect of rivastigmine is centrally mediated cholinergic 
gastrointestinal events, which can be minimized by slower dose-escalation 
intervals and administration with a full meal. Therapeutic dosing is 6-12 mg/day 
given twice daily, with higher doses having the potential for greater benefits.

BACKGROUND: For many years, visual hallucinations (VH) in idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease (PD) were thought to be a complication of antiparkinsonian treatment. 
The cause of VH is now thought to be nerve-cell loss and Lewy-body pathology in 
the ventral-temporal regions of the brain. However, the use of VH as a clinical 
sign of PD has not been investigated.
METHODS: 788 cases with parkinsonism archived at the Queen Square Brain Bank for 
Neurological Diseases were identified for study. Patients had not been given 
standardised antemortem assessments. Clinical records were assessed for reports 
of VH. The incidence of VH in pathologically diagnosed cases was calculated, and 
factors affecting onset of VH were investigated.
FINDINGS: VH occurred in 50% (221/445) of patients with PD, in 73% (32/44) with 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and in only 7% (18/255) of patients with 
non-Lewy-body parkinsonism. The specificity of VH for Lewy-body parkinsonism (PD 
and DLB combined) was 92.9% (95% CI 89.1-95.8) and the positive predictive value 
was 93.4% (89.7-95.8). VH were associated with cognitive dysfunction (hazard 
ratio 5.62, 3.37-9.35), autonomic dysfunction (3.13, 1.77-5.52), axial rigidity 
(2.22, 1.26-3.85) within the first 2 years of disease onset and also age of 
onset (1.05, 1.03-1.07). In PD, the onset of VH typically occurred in the second 
half of the disease course, and time to onset of VH was only weakly correlated 
with use of selegiline (Spearman's rho 0.22, p=0.005) and ergot dopamine 
agonists (0.24, p=0.006) but not correlated with use of levodopa, amantadine, or 
anticholinergic drugs.
INTERPRETATION: The presence of VH is helpful in the differentiation of PD from 
other non-Lewy-body causes of parkinsonism. We propose that VH be added, as a 
supportive criterion, to the operational clinical criteria for the diagnosis of 
PD.

BACKGROUND: Olfactory abnormalities are reported in Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease. Anosmia appears to be common in dementia with Lewy bodies 
but not in pure Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anosmia improves discrimination between the Lewy 
body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease and "pure" Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: 106 cases of necropsy confirmed pure Alzheimer's disease (n = 89) or 
LBV (n = 17) were reviewed. All had received butanol odour threshold testing. 
Anosmia was defined as a score < or = 1.0 on a 0-9 point scale. Logistic 
regression analysis was used to model potential predictors (for example, 
parkinsonism, smoking, hallucinations) of neuropathological diagnosis and 
anosmia.
RESULTS: LBV cases had an increased prevalence of anosmia (65%) compared with 
Alzheimer's disease (23%; odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, p = 0.00045), or normal elderly 
people (6.7%). Within the dementia cases, the negative predictive value (92%) 
and specificity (78%) of anosmia were both good; sensitivity for detecting LBV 
was 65%, but the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 35%. Logistic 
regression models showed anosmia (OR = 5.4, p = 0.005) and visual hallucinations 
(OR = 7.3, p = 0.007) were strong independent predictors of Lewy body pathology. 
When anosmia was added as a core feature to consensus diagnostic criteria for 
probable Lewy body dementia, five additional cases of LBV were detected (29% 
increased sensitivity), but with four additional false positives (1% increased 
discrimination, 4% decreased specificity, 33% decreased PPV).
CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is very common in LBV. Adding anosmia as a core feature 
improved sensitivity for detecting LBV, but did not improve discrimination 
between Alzheimer's disease and LBV owing to a concomitant increase in false 
positives.

Is Parkinson's disease a homogeneous disorder--what is the burden of Parkinson's 
disease in India.

Movement disorders are common neurological illnesses among the elderly. These 
include essential tremor, Perkinsonian disorders and chorea of different 
aetiologies. Parkinsonian disorders can be divided into two major groups of 
disorders--classical idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Parkinson plus syndrome. 
The most common and important cause of Parkinsonism is idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is most confidently clinically diagnosed 
if we follow the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank 
Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease. The most common degnerative 
diseases, which minic idiopathic Parkinson's disease are collectively called 
Parkinson plus syndrome. The most important diseases comprising Parkinson plus 
syndrome are: progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, 
cortical-basal ganglionic degneration, diffuse Lewy body disease and 
Parkinson-dementia-ALS complex. In India the prevalence of Parkinson's disease 
varied markedly from one study to another. The prevalence rate is high among the 
urban Parsi community of Mumbai. Incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease 
increase with increasing age. Some risk factors for Parkinson's disease have 
been narrated briefly. As the number of cases of Parkinsonism is likely to 
increase along with increasing population, the general practitioners or 
consultant physicans should have to play a greater role referring the cases to 
attend neurologists or movement disorder clinic early.

University Medical Center, Chicago, Ill 6012, USA.

As life expectancy continues to increase over time, dementia is becoming an 
increasingly more common problem and a major cause of disability in older 
persons. It is now more important than ever to identify and manage common causes 
of dementia given variations in disease course, treatments and the possibility 
for modification of risk factors. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a dementia 
syndrome characterized by progressive cognitive decline, with fluctuating 
cognition, recurrent detailed and well-formed hallucinations, and parkinsonism. 
This article aims to provide an overview of current concepts of DLB, including a 
description of the key clinical features and neuropathology, neurochemistry, and 
genetics of DLB, then a discussion of the relationship of DLB with Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease, and, finally, a summary of current management 
strategies available for this disorder.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
Examination (ACE), neuropsychological assessment, and a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)-based temporal lobe rating scale to the prediction of which 
patients with questionable dementia will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Fifty subjects (19 early AD, 31 questionable dementia [QD]) underwent 
the ACE, a neuropsychological evaluation, and a volumetric MRI. The degree of 
atrophy of hippocampal, parahippocampal, and other temporal lobe structures was 
assessed using a validated visual rating scale. Subjects were followed 8 monthly 
for an average of 19.1 months.
RESULTS: Of the 31 QD subjects, 11 converted to AD within 24 months of follow-up 
(another 2 developed dementia with Lewy bodies) and 18 were nonconverters. 
Converters were impaired relative to nonconverters at baseline on measures of 
episodic and semantic memory (category fluency and naming) and the ACE. 
Converters also had a greater degree of hippocampal and parahippocampal atrophy. 
Discriminant analysis demonstrated that the best single test for distinguishing 
converters was the ACE. In combination, the hippocampal rating and category 
fluency were also contributory.
CONCLUSIONS: Progression to AD in patients with QD is best predicted by 
neuropsychological measures, particularly those that assess episodic and 
semantic memory, although simple rating methods based on MRI may have an 
adjunctive role.

Medicine, Macon, GA 31201, USA. lauterbach_e@mercer.edu

The neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its correlates are reviewed. 
Dementia occurs in up to 30% and can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. 
Cognitive impairments involve executive, visuospatial, attentional, and memory 
dysfunctions. Apathy may respond to dopamine agonists or cholines-terase 
inhibitors. Cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression predict quality of 
life. Visual hallucinations and paranoia are common, and respond to low dose 
clozapine. Depression is common and predicts caregiver burden and depression. 
The best data suggest the efficacy of nortriptyline and the safety of SSRIs. 
Anxiety disorders occur in 40% of patients, especially off-period panic attacks 
and specific phobias. Bromazepam has proven useful for anxiety in PD, but 
buspirone has only diminished drug-induced dyskinesias to date. Sleep disorders 
occur in up to 94% of patients. Insomnia is common and is treated by 
dopaminergic agent dose reduction, nocturnal dosing, treatment of depression, or 
use of short half-lived hypnotics, depending on etiology. Parasomnias include 
REM behavior disorder and vivid dreams and nightmares. Excessive daytime 
somnolence occurs in at least 15% of patients. Sleep attacks are common and 
patients should be warned about driving when taking dopamine agonists. Sexual 
disorders occur in most patients. Paraphilias are associated with dopamine 
agonists, and clozapine may be useful in their treatment. Surgical therapies are 
associated with a wide variety of neuropsychiatric features, and vigilance for 
suicide attempts with subthalamic nucleus stimulation seems warranted. 
Neuropsychiatric disorders are important determinants of quality of life and 
caregiver burden in PD. More clinical research is needed to establish effective 
treatments.

brain stimulation surgery.

Network, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. valerie.voon@uhn.on.ca

OBJECT: Postoperative psychiatric symptoms have been associated with subthalamic 
deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD), and preoperative 
psychiatric vulnerability, the effects of surgery, stimulation, medication 
changes, and psychosocial adjustment have been proposed as causative factors. 
The variables involved in whether preoperative psychiatric symptoms improve or 
worsen following surgery are not yet known. In the present study, preoperative 
psychiatric symptoms were systematically assessed in patients with PD presenting 
for routine preoperative psychiatric assessment.
METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with PD presenting for DBS were interviewed 
using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Current depressive 
symptoms were quantified using clinician- and patient-rated depression scales. 
Seventy-eight percent of patients had at least one lifetime or current Axis I 
psychiatric diagnosis. The prevalence of depression was 60% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 45-85), psychosis 35% (95% CI 25-50), and anxiety 40% (95% CI 
25-55). These prevalence rates were comparable to or greater than those in the 
general population of patients with PD. Twenty-three percent of patients 
required psychiatric treatment for current symptoms prior to being considered 
eligible for DBS.
CONCLUSIONS: As part of the selection process for surgery, members of the study 
population were chosen for their lack of overt dementia or other active 
disabling psychiatric symptomatology. The incidence rates of psychiatric 
disorders, including those diseases occurring in the general population affected 
with PD, were greater than expected. Data in the present study lead one to 
question the reliability of patient-rated depression scales as the sole 
instrument for assessing depression. The authors highlight the need for 
evidence-based guidelines in the management of these preoperative symptoms as 
well as the involvement of psychiatric personnel in the assessment and 
management of these symptoms.

The National Academy of Sciences -- National Research Council (NAS-NRC) twin 
panel, created nearly 50 years ago, had twin zygosity determined primarily via a 
similarity questionnaire that has been estimated to correctly classify at least 
95% of twins. In the course of a study on the genetics of healthy ageing in the 
NAS-NRC twins, DNA was collected for genome-wide scanning and zygosity 
confirmation was examined in 343 participating pairs. The sample was 
supplemented from two other studies using NAS-NRC twins where one or both 
co-twins were suspected to have Alzheimer disease or another dementia, or 
Parkinson's disease. Overall 578 twin pairs with DNA were analyzed. Zygosity 
assignment for 96.8% (519/536) was confirmed via questionnaire. Among 42 pairs 
whose questionnaire responses were inconclusive for assigning zygosity, 50% were 
found to be monozygous (MZ) and 50% were dizygous (DZ). There was some evidence 
for greater misclassification of presumed DZ pairs in the healthy ageing study 
where participation favored pairs who were similar in having a favorable health 
history and willingness to volunteer without any element of perceived risk for a 
specific disease influencing participation.

Prevalence and severity of gait disorders in Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's 
dementias.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence, severity, and type of gait and balance 
disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson's 
disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's 
disease without dementia (PD), and age-matched controls.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Secondary care clinics in geriatric psychiatry, neurology, and 
geriatrics.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-five participants aged 65 and older (AD, n=40; 
VaD, n=39; PDD, n=46; DLB, n=32; PD, n=46; and controls, n=42).
MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence and severity of gait and balance disorders were 
assessed using the Tinetti gait and balance scale. The types of gait disorders 
in each diagnostic group were classified using the Nutt et al. classification.
RESULTS: Gait and balance disorders were more common with PDD (93%), VaD (79%), 
and DLB (75%) than with PD (43%) and AD (25%) and in controls (7%). The risk of 
gait and balance disorder was higher in the non-Alzheimer's dementia groups 
(VaD, PDD, and DLB) than in the AD group (odds ratio=15 (95% confidence 
interval=6-37). If a gait disorder was present in mild dementia (Cambridge 
Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly cognitive subsection score >65), 
this was diagnostic of non-Alzheimer's dementia, with sensitivity of 78% and 
specificity of 100%. Non-Alzheimer's dementia groups had worse Tinetti gait and 
balance scores than the AD group (all P<.001). The types of gait disorders 
discriminated between non-Alzheimer's dementias.
CONCLUSION: The findings support the idea that gait and balance assessment may 
augment the diagnostic evaluation of dementia.

Altered depression-related behavior and neurochemical changes in serotonergic 
neurons in mutant R406W human tau transgenic mice.

Mutant R406W human tau was originally identified in frontotemporal dementia and 
parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and causes a hereditary tauopathy 
that clinically resembles Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we 
examined the performance of R406W transgenic (Tg) mice in the forced swimming 
test, a test with high predictivity of antidepressant efficacy in human 
depression, and found an enhancement of the immobility time. In contrast, the 
motor function and anxiety-related emotional response of R406W Tg mice were 
normal. Furthermore, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), 
fluvoxamine (100 mg/kg, p.o.), significantly reduced this enhancement of the 
immobility time, whereas a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, desipramine, had no 
effect. In an in vivo microdialysis study, R406W Tg mice exhibited a 
significantly decreased extracellular 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) level 
in the frontal cortex and also exhibited a tendency toward a decreased 
extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level. Moreover, fluvoxamine, which 
reduced the enhancement of the immobility time, significantly increased the 
extracellular 5-HT level in R406W Tg mice. These results suggest that R406W Tg 
mice exhibit changes in depression-related behavior involving serotonergic 
neurons and provide an animal model for investigating AD with depression.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic profiles of patients with 
early (age<65 years) and late (age>or=65 years) onset of dementia in a memory 
disorders clinic in Japan. A total of 512 consecutive memory clinic patients 
were evaluated using clinical information and results of examinations. Diagnosis 
of dementia was made according to DSM-III-R, and that of subtypes according to 
standard diagnostic criteria. A total of 464 patients met the criteria for 
dementia. Amongst late-onset patients (n=430), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (48.1%) 
was the most frequent cause of dementia, followed by AD with cerebrovascular 
disease (CVD) (31.4%), vascular dementia (VaD) (9.1%), dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) (3.7%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (1.6%), and others 
(5.8%). On the contrary, amongst early onset patients (n=34), the most common 
dementia diagnosis was AD (38.2%), followed by VaD (23.5%), FTLD (14.7%), AD 
with CVD (5.9%), DLB (2.9%), and others (17.6%). FTLD and VaD were significantly 
more common in the early onset group. All patients, but one, with DLB and 
Parkinson's disease dementia were late-onset. The relative frequencies of AD, 
VaD, and DLB in our series are consistent with epidemiologic findings in several 
Western countries; however, the frequency of FTLD is not consistent with the 
previous findings presenting high frequency in late-onset patients in some 
Western countries.

The reliable identification of beta-aggregating stretches in protein sequences 
is essential for the development of therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases, as well as other pathological conditions associated with 
protein deposition. Here, a model based on physicochemical properties and 
computational design of beta-aggregating peptide sequences is shown to be able 
to predict the aggregation rate over a large set of natural polypeptide 
sequences. Furthermore, the model identifies aggregation-prone fragments within 
proteins and predicts the parallel or anti-parallel beta-sheet organization in 
fibrils. The model recognizes different beta-aggregating segments in mammalian 
and nonmammalian prion proteins, providing insights into the species barrier for 
the transmission of the prion disease.

Elevated serum homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of 
Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, elevated homocysteine levels are related to 
cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. The aim of the present study was to 
explore the disease specificity of the relation between serum total homocysteine 
levels and cognitive function. For this, we summarize data from several studies 
on homocysteine levels in both normal and pathological conditions performed in 
our laboratories and evaluate possible mechanisms of effects of elevated 
homocysteine levels in the central nervous system. Total homocysteine levels 
were measured in serum of: 1) healthy aging individuals; 2) patients with 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and patients with other cognitive disorders; 
and 3) patients with multiple sclerosis. Increased serum homocysteine 
concentration was related to worse cognitive performance over a 6-year period in 
the normal aging population (r=-0.36 to -0.14, p<0.01 for the Word learning 
tests; r=0.76, p<0.05 for the Stroop Colored Word test). Homocysteine was only 
increased in patients with Parkinson's disease on L-Dopa therapy (18.9 vs. 16.5 
micromol/L in healthy controls), and not in dementia patients. Homocysteine was 
elevated in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (15.0 micromol/L, n=39, 
compared to 12.0 micromol/L in 45 controls) and correlated to both cognitive and 
motor function (r=-0.33 and -0.33, p<0.05, respectively). The relationship 
between homocysteine and cognitive function in non-pathological and pathological 
situations indicates that changes in its levels may play a role in cognitive 
functioning in a broad spectrum of conditions.

Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations are associated with 
Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Several recent reports have indicated 
that L-dopa treatment is an acquired cause of hyperhomo-cysteinemia. Despite the 
fact that a large proportion of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients develop 
cognitive dysfunctions or dementia, particularly in the late stages of the 
illness and after long-term L-dopa treatment, the relationship between Hcy and 
dementia in PD has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate plasma Hcy levels in a group of L-dopa-treated PD patients with 
cognitive impairment and to elucidate a possible role of Hcy in the development 
of cognitive dysfunctions in PD. We compared Hcy, vitamin B12 and folate levels 
in 35 parkinsonian patients treated with L-dopa (14 with cognitive dysfunctions, 
21 without cognitive impairment). Analysis of the data revealed that mean Hcy 
levels were significantly higher in the group with cognitive dysfunctions 
(21.2+/-7.4 vs. 15.8+/-4.4 micromol/L; p=0.0001), while there was no difference 
in age, sex, B12 and folate levels. In addition, logistic regression analysis 
showed that the risk of cognitive dysfunction progressively increased according 
to Hcy levels after correction for age, sex and B-vitamin status (odds ratio, 
19.1; 95% CI, 1.5-241.4; p=0.02). Our results raise the possibility of a 
relationship between Hcy levels and cognitive dysfunctions in this group of 
L-dopa-treated PD patients. However, prospective studies on large cohorts of 
patients should be performed to clarify such an association.

Despite the current efficacious symptomatic approaches, the search is on for new 
therapies for Parkinson's disease that can control the cardinal symptoms of the 
disease (tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia), control/prevent motor complications 
induced by long-term levodopa, act on non-motor disease symptoms (dementia, 
dysautonomia, pain, insomnia, falls) and halt disease progression. Rasagiline is 
a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy against the 
cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease when used as monotherapy in early 
Parkinson's disease, and as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced disease stages. 
It reduces the duration and severity of poor symptom response episodes in 
fluctuating patients. Preliminary results allow discussion of putative effects 
of rasagiline on some non-motor signs and disease progression. This article 
outlines the evidence surrounding the efficacy and safety of rasagiline, and 
discusses its potential to address some of the currently unmet needs of 
Parkinson's disease therapy.

BACKGROUND: Iodine-123-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) myocardial 
scintigraphy has been used to evaluate cardiac sympathetic denervation in Lewy 
body disease (LBD) including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy 
bodies (DLB). Patients with LBD had marked reductions in cardiac MIBG 
accumulation, indicative of severe impairment of the cardiac sympathetic nervous 
systems. However, the differences in scintigraphy between DLB and PD have not 
been determined.
OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiac sympathetic function in early disease stage 
measured with 123I-MIBG scintigraphy between DLB and PD.
METHODS: 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 22 patients with 
early-stage DLB, 41 patients with early idiopathic PD and 15 normal control 
subjects who were matched for age and disease duration. The heart-to-mediastinum 
(H/M) ratio was calculated.
RESULTS: 123I-MIBG uptake of the myocardium was significantly lower in patients 
with early DLB than in controls. The mean value of H/M ratio in patients with 
DLB was significantly lower than those in patients with PD, independent of the 
Hoehn and Yahr stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cardiac sympathetic function in DLB is 
severely impaired even in the early disease stage.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder 
characterized by frequent infections, oculocutaneous albinism, high bleeding 
tendency, and various neurological symptoms. Onset in early childhood mostly 
leads to lymphohistiocytic infiltration into multiple organs, which is usually 
lethal without bone marrow transplantation. The adult form of CHS has a milder 
course, no lymphohistiocytic infiltration, and is characterized by neurological 
manifestations such as polyneuropathy, parkinsonism, dementia, and ataxia. In 
young adults, a combination of these defects with oculocutaneous albinism or 
recurrent infections should bring CHS into consideration. Diagnosis is 
established by the presence of characteristic eosinophilic peroxidase-positive 
giant granules in leukocytes. This article summarizes current knowledge about 
the pathogenesis, clinical course, and therapy of CHS and reports on experience 
with two adult CHS patients.

The authors used flash electroretinography to demonstrate dysfunction of the 
photopic and scotopic retina in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and 
visual hallucinations (VHs) compared with patients with Parkinson disease, 
patients without VHs, and controls. The retinal dysfunction may be related to 
slight alteration of the photoreceptors and numerous pale inclusions in the 
outer plexiform layer found at the post mortem examination, suggesting a 
specific retinopathy.

OBJECTIVES: Amisulpride is a substituted benzamide derivative with atypical 
antipsychotic properties and low side effects.
METHOD: We report four cases of patients with clinically and genetically 
established Huntington's disease and signs of psychosis who were treated with 
Amisulpride.
RESULTS: Two patients developed extrapyramidal side effects due to the 
treatment. The antipsychotic therapy of all patients was effective.
DISCUSSION: Due to degeneration of striatal neurons patients suffering from 
Huntington's disease react early with development of extrapyramidal side effects 
after therapy with amisulpride.

Although Parkinson disease (PD) is primarily considered a movement disorder, the 
high prevalence of psychiatric complications suggests that it is more accurately 
conceptualized as a neuropsychiatric disease. Affective disorders, cognitive 
impairment, and psychosis are particularly common in PD and are associated with 
excess disability, worse quality of life, poorer outcomes, and caregiver 
distress. Yet, in spite of this and their frequent occurrence, there is 
incomplete understanding of the epidemiology, phenomenology, risk factors, 
neuropathophysiology, and optimal treatment strategies for these disorders. 
Psychiatric complications are typically comorbid, and there is great intra- and 
inter-individual variability in presentation. The hallmark 
neuropathophysiological changes that occur in PD plus the association between 
exposure to dopaminergic medications and certain psychiatric disorders suggest a 
neurobiological basis for most psychiatric symptoms, although psychological 
factors are probably involved in the development of affective disorders. 
Although antidepressants, antipsychotics, and cognition-enhancing agents are 
commonly prescribed in PD, controlled studies demonstrating efficacy and 
tolerability of these drugs are virtually nonexistent. Because of the high 
prevalence and complexity of psychiatric complications in PD, geriatric 
psychiatrists are in a position to offer valuable consultation and clinical care 
to this population. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, 
pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of the most common 
psychiatric complications in PD.

Treatment with statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitors) reduces the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with increased 
risk of vascular disease. Recent experimental data point to neuroprotective 
properties of statins in acute cerebral ischemia. There is a proven link between 
bioavailability of nitric oxide and the activity of statins and ischemic stroke. 
Due to their ability to up-regulate nitric oxide synthase, statins have been 
considered in the therapy of a number of the central nervous system disorders, 
including cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, tumors, 
and trauma. It has been claimed that they suppress inflammatory response and 
secondary injury after acute ischemia.

The development of imaging biomarkers which target specific sites in the brain 
represents a significant advance in neurodegenerative diseases and Parkinson's 
disease with the promise of new and improved approaches for the early and 
accurate diagnosis of disease as well as novel ways to monitor patients and 
assess treatment. The 3 major applications of imaging may play a role in 
Parkinson's disease include: 1) the use of neuroimaging as a biomarker of 
disease in order to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of 
diagnosis; 2) objective monitoring of the progression of disease to provide a 
molecular phenotype of Parkinson's disease which may illuminate some of the 
sources of clinical variability; 3) the evaluation of so-called 
''disease-modifying'' treatments designed to retard the progression of disease 
by interfering with pathways thought implicated in the ongoing neuronal loss or 
replace dopamine-producing cells. Each of these areas has shown a numbers of 
critical clinical investigations which have better defined the utility of the 
imaging tools to these tasks. Nonetheless, current unresolved issues around the 
clinical role of neuroimaging in monitoring patients over time and validation of 
quantitative imaging measures of dopaminergic function are immediate issues for 
the field and the subject of current research efforts and the extension of the 
lessons learned in Parkinson's to other neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's dementia.

Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) is 
caused by mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein, 
tau. Some FTDP-17 mutations affect exon 10 splicing. To correct aberrant exon 10 
splicing while retaining endogenous transcriptional control, we evaluated the 
feasibility of using spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) to 
reprogram tau mRNA. We designed a pre-trans-splicing molecule containing human 
tau exons 10 to 13 and a binding domain complementary to the 3' end of tau 
intron 9. A minigene comprising tau exons 9, 10, and 11 and minimal flanking 
intronic sequences was used as a target. RT-PCR analysis of SH-SY5Y cells or COS 
cells cotransfected with a minigene and a pre-trans-splicing molecule using 
primers to opposite sides of the predicted splice junction generated products 
containing exons 9 to 13. Sequencing of the chimeric products showed that an 
exact exon 9-exon 10 junction had been created, thus demonstrating that tau RNA 
can be reprogrammed by trans-splicing. Furthermore, by using the same paradigm 
with a minigene containing full-length intronic sequences, we show that 
cis-splicing exclusion of exon 10 can be by-passed by trans-splicing and that 
conversion of exon 10(-) tau RNA into exon 10(+) tau RNA could be achieved with 
approximately 34% efficiency. Our results demonstrate that an alternatively 
spliced exon can be replaced by trans-splicing and open the way to novel 
therapeutic applications of SMaRT for tauopathies and other disorders linked to 
aberrant alternative splicing.

Postmenopausal women who are infected with HIV are at risk for experiencing 
dementia and Parkinson's-like symptoms associated with low levels of estrogen. 
Neurotoxic damage leading to these symptoms may involve HIV-associated proteins 
gp120 and/or tat(1-72) (tat). Our hypothesis is that 17beta-Estradiol (E(2)) is 
an effective agent for protection against gp120/tat-induced damage associated 
with increased oxidative stress, with particular focus on peroxynitrite-induced 
oxidative stress. We used SK-N-SH cells and striatal synaptosomes from 
Sprague-Dawley rats as model systems to assess neuroprotection by E(2). Cells 
coincubated with SIN-1(3-morpholinosydnonimine) or tat and gp120, together or 
separately, significantly increased oxidative stress on the SK-N-SH cells, as 
indicated by the increase in the levels of dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) 
fluorescence. These data suggest that a component of tat and gp120 neurotoxicity 
may be due to increased oxidative stress. Coincubation with E(2) attenuated tat- 
and gp120-induced increase in fluorescence. Coincubation with progesterone had 
no effect on tat-induced fluorescence, whereas coincubation with the E(2) 
antagonist ICI 182,780 and E(2) completely prevented the effects observed with 
E(2) alone. Both gp120 and tat decreased [(3)H] dopamine uptake into striatal 
synaptosomes by decreasing the V(max) of the dopamine transporter (DAT). 
Pretreatment of synaptosomes with E(2) (100 nM) partially reversed this 
reduction. In conclusion, E(2) appears to be effective for preventing the 
oxidative stress and loss of DAT function associated with gp120/tat 
neurotoxicity.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
repetitive TBI (rTBI) may culminate in dementia pugilistica (DP), a syndrome 
characterized by progressive dementia, parkinsonism, and the hallmark brain 
lesions of AD, including neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), formed by abnormal tau 
filaments and senile plaques (SPs) composed of Abeta fibrils. Previous study 
showed that mild rTBI (mrTBI) accelerated the deposition of Abeta in the brains 
of transgenic (Tg) mice (Tg2576) that over-express human Abeta precursor 
proteins with the familial AD Swedish mutations (APP695swe) and model of AD-like 
amyloidosis. Here, we report studies of the effects of mrTBI on AD-like tau 
pathologies in Tg mice expressing the shortest human tau isoform (T44) subjected 
to mrTBI, causing brain concussion without structural brain damage to simulate 
injuries linked to DP. Twelve-month-old Tg T44 (n = 18) and wild-type (WT; n = 
24) mice were subjected to mrTBI (four times a day, 1 day per week, for 4 weeks; 
n = 24) or sham treatment (n = 18). Histopathological analysis of mice at 9 
months after mrTBI revealed that one of the Tg T44 mice showed extensive 
telencephalic NFT and cerebral atrophy. Although statistical analysis of 
neurobehavioral tests at 6 months after mrTBI did not show any significant 
difference in any of groups of mice, the Tg T44 mouse with extensive NFT had an 
exceptionally low neurobehavioral score. The reasons for the augmentation of tau 
pathologies in only one T44 tau Tg mouse subjected to mrTBI remain to be 
elucidated.

DJ-1 gene mutations have been found to cause early-onset Parkinson's disease. We 
report a family from southern Italy with three brothers affected by early-onset 
parkinsonism, dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Molecular analysis of 
the DJ-1 gene in two living patients showed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 
7 (E163K) and a new homozygous mutation (g.168_185dup) in the promoter region of 
the gene. Both mutations cosegregated with the disease and were detected in a 
heterozygous state in the patients' mother and their healthy siblings. Our 
findings expand the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with mutations 
in DJ-1 gene.

Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) 
cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Clinical 
variability is seen not only among families with different mutations, but also 
among family members with the same mutation. We investigated a newly identified 
familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism family. The disease was of 
early onset and was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, 
parkinsonism was the prominent and often early feature, and it preceded 
dementia. Three autopsied cases shared involvement predominantly in the frontal 
and temporal lobes and also in the subcortical nuclei, including substantia 
nigra, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, that microscopically consisted 
of neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and astrocytic fibrosis. 
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuropil threads, ballooned cells, and glial 
fibrillary tangles. Sequencing analysis of the MAPT gene showed an alteration in 
one allele, resulting in a P301S substitution. These findings suggest that the 
MAPT P301S mutation can cause pathologically subcortical-predominant, neuropil 
thread-rich, tau-containing lesions, which could result in consistent 
parkinsonism. Our study confirms the notion that the phenotype observed in 
affected individuals from P301S MAPT mutation families is heterogeneous and is 
broader than the phenotypes seen to date in affected family members carrying 
other MAPT mutations.

clinician will automatically include uncommon dementias in the diagnostic 
considerations, as familial uncommon dementias due to genetic mutations 
frequently present as early-onset dementias. This paper highlights why uncommon 
dementias due to genetic mutations, although marginal in terms of prevalence 
numbers in the total population, are of significance in the quest to unravel the 
underlying cause of common dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia 
with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and vascular dementia 
(VaD).

Several genetic disorders, though rare, are associated or present with dementia. 
Developments in the field of genetics are contributing to clarify and expand our 
knowledge of the complex physiopathological mechanisms leading to 
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Disorders associated with misfolded and 
aggregated proteins and lipid, metal or energy metabolism are examples of the 
multifarious disease processes converging in the clinical features of dementia, 
either as its predominant feature, as in cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or as part of a cohort of accompanying or 
late-developing symptoms, as in Parkinson's disease (PD) or amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis with dementia (ALS-D). Awareness of these disorders, allied with 
recent advances in genetic, biochemical and neuroimaging techniques, may lead to 
early diagnosis, successful treatment and better prognosis.

USA. thorpy@aecom.yu.edu

Sleep disorders are common in PD and many factors can contribute to disturbed 
nocturnal sleep and daytime sleepiness. Factors contributing to sleep 
disturbance include the presence of insomnia, mood or anxiety disorders, 
dementia, specific sleep disorders, PD motor disorders, and the effects of PD or 
medications. Patients who have PD should be interrogated about sleep disturbance 
and daytime sleepiness and preferably, because of underestimation of the 
severity of sleepiness or lack of awareness, patients should be interviewed in 
the presence of a close friend or relative. The ability to drive, if sleepiness 
is present, should be assessed and appropriate recommendations made. Treatment 
of sleepiness involves treating any underlying sleep disturbance and may involve 
the use of stimulant or alerting medications in the daytime.

Metal ions and oxidative protein modification in neurological disease.

This review highlights the role of oxidative stress and imbalances in metal ion 
homeostasis in the neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease and in the progressive demyelinating disease multiple 
sclerosis. The chemistry and biochemistry of oxidative stress-induced protein 
damage are first described, followed by the evidence for a pathological role of 
oxidative stress in these disease states. It is tempting to speculate that free 
radical oxygen chemistry contributes to pathogenesis in all these conditions, 
though it is as yet undetermined what types of oxidative changes occur early in 
the disease, and what types are secondary manifestations of neuronal 
degeneration.

Neuropsychological and motor deficits in Parkinson's disease that may contribute 
to driving impairment were examined in a cohort study comparing patients with 
Parkinson's disease (PD) to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to 
healthy elderly controls. Nondemented individuals with Parkinson's disease 
[Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage I-III], patients with Alzheimer's disease [Clinical 
Demetia Rating scale (CDR) range 0-1], and elderly controls, who were actively 
driving, completed a neuropsychological battery and a standardized road test 
administered by a professional driving instructor. On-road driving ability was 
rated on number of driving errors and a global rating of safe, marginal, or 
unsafe. Overall, Alzheimer's patients were more impaired drivers than 
Parkinson's patients. Parkinson's patients distinguished themselves from other 
drivers by a head-turning deficiency. Drivers with neuropsychological impairment 
were more likely to be unsafe drivers in both disease groups compared to 
controls. Compared to controls, unsafe drivers with Alzheimer's disease were 
impaired across all neuropsychological measures except finger tapping. Driving 
performance in Parkinson's patients was related to disease severity (H&Y), 
neuropsychological measures [Rey Osterreith Complex Figure (ROCF), Trails B, 
Hopkins Verbal List Learning Test (HVLT)-delay], and specific motor symptoms 
(axial rigidity, postural instability), but not to the Unified Parkinson Disease 
Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score. Multifactorial measures (ROCF, Trails B) were 
useful in distinguishing safe from unsafe drivers in both patient groups.

Action fluency in Parkinson's disease: a follow-up study.

Raffaele Arcangelo Hospital, Venice, Italy. matteo.signorini@unive.it

The impairment in action fluency task present in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
patients has been previously interpreted as an indicator of conversion from PD 
to PD with dementia or as a grammatical deficit for verbs and ascribed to a 
frontostriatal loop pathophysiology. In the present study, 20 patients with PD 
without dementia were longitudinally tested with overall cognitive decline 
scales and semantic, letter, and action fluency tasks in a 24-month follow-up 
study. In comparison with healthy age-matched controls, PD patients showed a 
stable and consistent impairment on action fluency without any sign of cognitive 
decline. Our findings suggest that action fluency task may be an early sign of 
impairment of frontostriatal circuits in PD and it cannot be considered an 
indicator of conversion from PD to PD with dementia.

The utility of EEG in dementia: a clinical perspective.

Adamis D(1), Sahu S, Treloar A.

Author information:

London, UK.

BACKGROUND: Despite being simple and cheap, the EEG is not often used in 
clinical practice.
METHODOLOGY: Literature search using PUBMED and Medline.
RESULTS: Quantitative EEG can help to identify mild dementia and mild cognitive 
impairment and can increase diagnostic accuracy when used with other imaging 
techniques. EEG helps differentiate organic from functional brain disease and 
predict response to cholinesterase inhibitors and is central in the diagnosis of 
Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. The accuracy of EEG may be greater than that of CT or 
MRI scans alone.
DISCUSSION: Quantitative EEG may save on specialist interpretation time and 
enable more routine use of EEG in diagnosis and care. More widespread use of 
EEG's is indicated. Agreement on the parameters that are best measured on qEEG 
is still awaited.

The contribution of statistical parametric mapping in the assessment of 
precuneal and medial temporal lobe perfusion by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT in mild 
Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia.

AIM: To assess the role of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon 
emission computed tomography (99mTc-HMPAO SPECT) imaging of the precuneus and 
medial temporal lobe in the individual patient with mild Alzheimer's disease and 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using statistical parametric mapping and visual 
image interpretation.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients with mild late-onset Alzheimer's disease, 20 
patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, 15 patients with DLB and 31 
healthy controls were studied. All patients fulfilled appropriate clinical 
criteria; the DLB patients also had evidence of dopaminergic presynaptic 
terminal loss on 
123I-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane 
imaging. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT brain scans were acquired on a multidetector gamma 
camera and images were assessed separately by visual interpretation and with 
SPM99.
RESULTS: Statistical parametric maps were significantly more accurate than 
visual image interpretation in all disease categories. In patients with mild 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease, statistical parametric mapping demonstrated 
significant hypoperfusion to the precuneus in 59% and to the medial temporal 
lobe in 53%. Seventy-six per cent of these patients had a defect in either 
location. No controls had precuneal or medial temporal lobe hypoperfusion 
(specificity, 100%). Statistical parametric mapping also demonstrated 73% of 
patients with DLB to have precuneal abnormalities, but only 6% had medial 
temporal lobe involvement.
CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate the capability of statistical parametric 
mapping to demonstrate reliable abnormalities in the majority, but not all, 
patients with either mild Alzheimer's disease or DLB. Precuneal hypoperfusion is 
not specific to Alzheimer's disease and is equally likely to be found in DLB. In 
this study, medial temporal hypoperfusion was significantly more common in 
Alzheimer's disease than in DLB. Statistical parametric maps appear to be 
considerably more reliable than simple visual interpretation of 99mTc-HMPAO 
images for these regions.

with dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To study the use of transcranial sonography (TCS) in discriminating 
between patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease 
with dementia (PDD).
METHODS: Fourteen patients with DLB, 31 with PDD and 73 with PD without dementia 
(PDnD) were studied with TCS.
RESULTS: All assessable patients with DLB, 97% with PDD, and 94% with PDnD 
showed at least unilateral hyperechogenicity of substantia nigra (SN). However, 
bilateral marked SN hyperechogenicity was present in 80% of DLB patients but 
only in one third of PDD and PDnD patients, and was associated with younger age 
at disease onset in PD but not in DLB. An asymmetry index > or = 1.15 of 
bilateral SN echogenic sizes, estimated by division of larger size by smaller 
size, was found in 69% of PDD patients but only 20% of DLB patients. Combination 
of SN echogenic sizes, asymmetry indices and onset age discriminated PDD from 
DLB with a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 80% and a positive predictive 
value of 93%. TCS of brainstem raphe, thalami, lenticular nuclei, caudate nuclei 
and ventricle widths did not discriminate between DLB and PDD. Compared with 
PDnD patients, DLB and PDD patients exhibited significantly larger widths of 
third ventricle and of frontal horns. In PDD patients, scores on the Unified 
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale correlated with widths of third ventricle and 
of frontal horns.
CONCLUSIONS: SN hyperechogenicity is typical for PDD and DLB. However, size, 
asymmetry and relation of SN hyperechogenicity to age at disease onset 
discriminate PDD from DLB.

We describe a patient with a combination of dystonic and parkinsonian signs. 
Paraclinical studies revealed a mutation in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene (GCH1) 
and a decrease in 
[123I]-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane 
(123I-FP-CIT) binding ratios indicative of Parkinson's disease. We conclude that 
the patient probably suffers from a variant of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) or 
two separate movement disorders, normally considered to be differential 
diagnoses, DRD and early-onset Parkinson's disease with resulting difficulties 
concerning treatment and prognosis.

Further evidence for LBP-1c/CP2/LSF association in Alzheimer's disease families.

TJ, Blacker D, Tanzi RE.

Diseases (MIND), Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 
Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Several studies suggested chromosome 12 harbours an Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) risk factor gene. Significant association of a single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' UTR of transcription factor CP2 (LBP-1c/CP2/LSF or 
TFCP2) at 12q13 was reported in three independent case-control studies, but no 
family based analyses have been performed to date.
METHODS: Genotypes for three SNPs were generated in two independent AD family 
samples. A meta-analysis on all published case-control studies was also 
performed.
RESULTS: The A allele of the 3' UTR SNP was associated with increased risk for 
AD in one sample (odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 
4.3), but not in the other, possibly due to low power. Haplotype analyses showed 
that this allele is part of a putative risk-haplotype overtransmitted to 
affected individuals in one sample and in both samples combined. Meta-analysis 
of the previously associated 3' UTR SNP showed a trend towards a protective 
effect of the A allele in AD (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.1).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine LBP-1c/CP2/LSF in AD families, 
and the fifth to independently show significant association. While our results 
support a role of this gene in AD pathogenesis, the direction of the effect 
remains uncertain, possibly indicating linkage disequilibrium with another 
variant nearby.

Association of homocysteine with plasma amyloid beta protein in aging and 
neurodegenerative disease.

Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. mirizarry@partners.org

BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and is reported to be an independent risk factor for 
Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline. tHcy may potentiate neurotoxic and 
vasculopathic processes, including amyloid beta protein (Abeta) metabolism, 
implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of plasma total tHcy levels with 
clinical, demographic, biochemical, and genetic factors in aging, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and Parkinson disease 
(PD).
METHODS: Plasma tHcy, folate, vitamin B(12), creatinine, and Abeta levels were 
assessed in individuals evaluated in the Memory, Stroke, and Movement Disorders 
Units of Massachusetts General Hospital with diagnoses of AD (n = 145), MCI (n = 
47), PD (n = 93), CAA (67), hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (hICH) (n = 
25), and no dementia (n = 88).
RESULTS: The tHcy levels did not differ across AD, MCI, CAA, hICH, and 
nondemented control subjects but were increased in the PD group (p < 0.01). The 
elevated levels within the PD group were due to high tHcy in individuals taking 
levodopa (p < 0.0001). Increasing tHcy was associated with worse cognition in 
the PD cases, but not the other diagnostic groups. tHcy levels positively 
correlated with plasma Abeta levels even after adjustments for age and 
creatinine (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mean tHcy levels increased with age but did not discriminate 
diagnostic groups aside from significant elevation in patients with PD taking 
levodopa. The positive association between tHcy and plasma Abeta levels raises 
the possibility that these circulating factors could interact to affect AD risk 
and cognition in PD.

(1)Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Virginia School of 
Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA. rda3e@virginia.edu

OBJECTIVE: To determine if excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) can predate future 
Parkinson disease (PD).
METHODS: EDS was assessed in 3,078 men aged 71 to 93 years in the Honolulu-Asia 
Aging Study from 1991 to 1993. All were free of prevalent PD and dementia. 
Follow-up for incident PD was based on three repeat neurologic assessments from 
1994 to 2001.
RESULTS: During the course of follow-up, 43 men developed PD (19.9/10,000 
person-years). After age adjustment, there was more than a threefold excess in 
the risk of PD in men with EDS vs men without EDS (55.3 vs 17.0/10,000 
person-years; odds ratio [OR] = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.4 to 7.0; p = 0.004). Additional 
adjustment for insomnia, cognitive function, depressed mood, midlife cigarette 
smoking and coffee drinking, and other factors failed to alter the association 
between EDS and PD (OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.4; p = 0.014). Other sleep 
related features such as insomnia, daytime napping, early morning grogginess, 
and frequent nocturnal awakening showed little relation with the risk of PD.
CONCLUSIONS: Excessive daytime sleepiness may be associated with an increased 
risk of developing Parkinson disease.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of 
California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. amcmurtray@mednet.ucla.edu

BACKGROUND: Research on the epidemiology of dementia has focused on the elderly. 
Few investigations have studied differences in etiologic frequencies between 
early-onset dementia (EOD), with onset at an age of less than 65 years old, and 
the more common late-onset disorder.
OBJECTIVES: To determine relative frequencies and characteristics of EOD versus 
late-onset dementia (LOD; age of onset > or =65 years) diagnosed in a large 
memory disorders program over a 4-year period.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records, including an extensive neurobehavioral and 
neurological evaluation, of all patients seen at a large Veteran's Affairs 
Medical Center Memory Disorders clinic between 2001 and 2004 and assessed 
demographic variables, final diagnoses, presence of dementia, and differential 
diagnosis of dementing illnesses.
RESULTS: Among 1,683 patients presenting for evaluation of an acquired decline 
in memory or cognition, 948 (56%) met established clinical criteria for a 
dementing illness. About 30% (n = 278) of these had an age of onset of <65 
years, compared to 670 with LOD. Patients were predominantly male (98%). 
Compared to the late-onset group, the EOD patients were less severely impaired 
on presentation, but they did not differ in gender distribution or educational 
background. The EOD group had significantly more dementia attributed to 
traumatic brain injury, alcohol, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration compared to the LOD patients. In contrast, the 
LOD group had significantly more Alzheimer's disease compared to the EOD group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, conducted at a Veterans Affairs Hospital, is the 
largest series to date on EOD, and found a previously unexpectedly large number 
of patients below the age of 65 with cognitive deficits and impaired functioning 
consequent to head trauma, alcohol abuse, and HIV. These findings highlight the 
differential distribution and importance of preventable causes of dementia in 
the young.

    Acta Neurol Scand. 2006 May;113(5):353-4.

OBJECTIVE: To examine if risk factors for cerebrovascular disease would increase 
the risk for dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: Non-demented patients were recruited from an epidemiological study of 
PD in the county of Rogaland, Norway. PD and dementia were diagnosed according 
to strict diagnostic criteria. Established cerebrovascular risk factors were 
recorded at baseline, and their influence on incident dementia was assessed 4 
years later using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 171 non-demented PD patients constituted the at-risk 
population. Seventy-two (55%) had at least one cerebrovascular risk factor. A 
total of 130 subjects (96% of survivors) completed the follow-up examination. 
Forty-three (33%) new cases of dementia were found. Twenty-five of the 72 (35%) 
patients with and 18 of the 58 (31%) subjects without any risk factor developed 
dementia (ns). A significant association with dementia was found for a diagnosis 
of heart failure in the univariate analyses. However, in the logistic regression 
analysis none of the cerebrovascular risk factors were significantly associated 
with incident dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large and representative cohort of patients with PD 
cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with incident dementia, 
indicating that the disease-related degenerative brain changes are the main 
causes of dementia in PD.

Iowa City, IA, USA. ergun-uc@uiowa.edu

OBJECTIVE: To determine the profiles of visual dysfunction and their 
relationship to motor and cognitive dysfunction and to disability in mild to 
moderate Parkinson disease (PD) without dementia.
METHODS: Seventy-six independently living participants with mild to moderate PD 
and 161 neurologically normal older adults were studied using a comprehensive 
battery to assess visual acuity, contrast sensitivity (CS), visual speed of 
processing and attention, spatial and motion perception, visual and verbal 
memory, visuoconstructional abilities, executive functions, depression, and 
motor function.
RESULTS: Participants with PD scored significantly worse on all tests of vision 
and cognition compared with normal elderly persons. Reduced CS contributed to 
deficits on tests of spatial and motion perception and attention in participants 
with PD. Impairments in visual attention and spatial perception predicted worse 
cognitive function. Worse performances on tests of visual speed of processing 
and attention, spatial and motion perception, visual construction, and executive 
functions correlated with measures of postural instability and gait difficulty 
(in the Motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). 
Impairments in motor function, visual memory, mood, and executive functions 
predicted worse disability as measured by Schwab-England Activities of Daily 
Living Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease showed impaired 
visual perception and cognition compared with elderly control subjects. Visual 
dysfunction contributes to parkinsonian disability through its influences on 
cognition and locomotion.

The North American Multiple System Atrophy Study Group involves investigators in 
12 US medical centers funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. 
The objectives are to examine the environmental and genetic risk factors for 
MSA; elucidate pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disorder; and refine 
evaluations used for assessment. During its first year, the group enrolled 87 
patients, implemented four cores, and initiated four scientific projects. Most 
patients among the 87 had parkinsonian features, which frequently began 
asymmetrically and remained asymmetrical; one-third responded to levodopa and 
many developed levodopa complications; almost two-thirds of the patients had 
cerebellar dysfunction, of these 90% had ataxia; urinary incontinence occurred 
commonly, and sleep disorders affected most. The investigators studied the 
effects of oxidative and nitrative stress upon the formation of alpha-synuclein 
inclusions; generated transgenic models of alpha-synuclein accumulation that 
recapitulate several behavioral and neuropathological features of MSA; and 
compared the severity of the autonomic features of MSA, Parkinson's disease and 
dementia with Lewy bodies.

University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. rwilson@rush.edu

OBJECTIVE: The authors tested the relationship of hallucinations and delusions 
to mortality in Alzheimer disease (AD).
METHODS: A group of 407 persons with clinically diagnosed AD completed a uniform 
clinical evaluation, after which vital status was monitored for a mean of 3.7 
years. At the initial evaluation, a previously established, structured, 
informant interview was used to ascertain the presence of hallucinations and 
delusional thinking. The evaluation also included a structured medical history, 
inspection of all medications, and detailed assessment of cognitive functioning 
and parkinsonian signs.
RESULTS: At study onset, hallucinations were present in 41.0% of participants 
and delusions in 54.4%. During follow-up, 146 deaths occurred. In a 
proportional-hazards model adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, 
hallucinations were associated with a 78% increase in risk of death. The 
association was not substantially altered in subsequent analyses that controlled 
for level of cognitive impairment, severity of parkinsonism, use of 
antipsychotic medications, and the presence of chronic medical conditions. Risk 
of death was more than doubled in those with both auditory and visual 
hallucinations. By contrast, we did not find evidence of an association of 
delusions with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Hallucinations are associated with an increased risk of death in AD.

Age-dependent neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuron loss, and memory 
impairment in a mouse model of human tauopathy (P301L).

Here, we describe the generation of a novel transgenic mouse model of human 
tauopathy. The rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mouse expresses the P301L mutation in tau 
(4R0N) associated with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to 
chromosome 17. Transgene expression was driven by a forebrain-specific Ca(2+) 
calmodulin kinase II promoter system resulting in high levels of expression in 
the hippocampus and neocortex. Importantly, transgene expression in this model 
is induced via the tetracycline-operon responsive element and is suppressed 
after treatment with doxycycline. Continued transgene expression in 
rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mice results in age-dependent development of many salient 
characteristics of hereditary human dementia. From an early age, 
immunohistochemical studies demonstrated abnormal biochemical processing of tau 
and the presence of pathological conformation- and phosphorylation-dependent 
epitopes. Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology was first observed in the 
neocortex and progressed into the hippocampus and limbic structures with 
increasing age. Consistent with the formation of NFTs, immunoblots indicated an 
age-dependent transition of accumulating tau species from Sarkosyl soluble 55 
kDa to insoluble hyperphosphorylated 64 kDa. Ultrastructural analysis revealed 
the presence of straight tau filaments. Furthermore, the effects of tau(P301L) 
expression on spatial reference memory were longitudinally tested using the 
Morris water maze. Compared with nontransgenic age-matched control littermates, 
rTg(tau(P301L))4510 mice developed significant cognitive impairments from 4 
months of age. Memory deficits were accompanied by gross forebrain atrophy and a 
prominent loss of neurons, most strikingly in hippocampal subdivision CA1. 
Collectively, these data describe a novel transgenic mouse that closely mimics 
human tauopathy and may represent an important model for the future study of 
tau-related neurodegenerative disease.

Previous psychiatric history as a risk factor for late-life dementia: a 
population-based case-control study.

London SE5 8AF, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that risk for dementia in late life is 
increased by a history of earlier psychiatric illness, and to examine the 
specificity of any such association.
METHODS: Frequency of earlier treated psychiatric illness was established by 
record searches and informant histories for all persons aged over 60 who were 
entered on the Camberwell dementia case register over a 2-year period and for an 
individually matched control group of the local elderly population, drawn from 
the files of the area Family Health Services Authority.
RESULTS: Of 559 persons with a clinical diagnosis of dementia, 70 (12.5%) had a 
history of psychiatric illness long preceding, and apparently unrelated to, the 
onset of dementia. When these patients were compared with a matched comparison 
group of dementia register patients who had no recorded psychiatric history, the 
two groups appeared broadly similar in type of dementia, severity and clinical 
features. Sixty-three of the earlier psychiatric histories could be identified 
from the available medical records alone. Applying the same procedure to the 
matched control group of Camberwell residents yielded from the 559 only 19 
(3.4%) with a history of treated psychiatric illness before the age of 70. The 
difference in case frequency between the two groups was highly significant and 
corresponded to an estimated odds ratio of 3.6. The increase in risk, which was 
not restricted to dementia of Alzheimer type, appeared to be characteristic of 
major psychiatric illness, rather than specific for depression.
CONCLUSION: There is a positive association between previous psychiatric history 
and late-life dementia which is of predictive significance. The underlying 
causal links merit further research.

(1)Department of Psychiatry, Central Hospital, Warwick, UK.

BACKGROUND: Few UK studies have examined the associations of residential or 
nursing home placement in dementia sufferers.
METHOD: 124 patients with mild to moderate dementia (according to the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, revised) and in 
contact with clinical services were evaluated with a detailed standardized 
assessment and followed-up at monthly intervals for 1 year.
RESULTS: 25 (21.6%) of the 116 patients living at home were admitted to 
residential or nursing home care during the follow-up year. Institutional 
placement was associated with greater severity of cognitive impairment, severity 
of parkinsonism and the failure of carers to adopt active coping strategies.
CONCLUSION: An intervention to improve coping skills in carers may decrease the 
rates of residential and nursing home placement.

The cessation of ovarian estrogen production occurring around the time of 
menopause has the potential to influence central nervous system function, as 
well as a number of neurological disorders that affect women during midlife and 
old age, including memory loss and mild cognitive impairment, ischemic stroke, 
Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. During midlife, there is 
observational evidence that episodic memory is not substantially affected by 
natural menopause or by use of estrogen-containing hormone therapy, but 
short-term clinical trial evidence suggests hormone therapy might benefit verbal 
memory after surgical menopause. Clinical trial data indicate that hormone 
therapy does not reduce, and may increase, stroke incidence. Parkinson's disease 
and Alzheimer's disease are the 2 most common neurodegenerative illnesses. 
Estrogen influences dopaminergic pathways within the central nervous system. 
However, available observational evidence is limited and inconclusive regarding 
any role of hormone therapy in influencing risk or symptoms of Parkinson's 
disease, a disorder of dopaminergic neurons. Finally, clinical trial data 
indicate that hormone therapy should not be initiated in the late postmenopause 
with the goal of improving memory, preventing cognitive decline, reducing 
dementia risk, or improving Alzheimer's disease symptoms. An important priority 
for clinical investigation is to determine whether hormone therapy used during 
the menopausal transition and early postmenopause has long-term effects on 
cognition or dementia risk. The critical window hypothesis as applied to 
Alzheimer's disease conjectures that effects of early hormone therapy might 
differ from those of hormone therapy initiated in the late postmenopause, but 
convincing evidence is yet to be obtained.

Nurr1 in Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

Chu Y(1), Le W, Kompoliti K, Jankovic J, Mufson EJ, Kordower JH.

Illinois 60612, USA.

In mammals, the transcription factor Nurr1 is expressed early in development and 
continues to be detectable throughout the organism's lifetime. Nurr1 is involved 
in the establishment and maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype within 
specific central nervous system neuronal subpopulations including the 
nigrostriatal dopamine system. This protein is reduced over the course of normal 
aging, which is a major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, 
whether Nurr1 expression is affected by PD has not been documented. The present 
study examined the role of Nurr1 in the maintenance of the dopaminergic 
phenotype within neurons in substantia nigra in PD compared with patients with 
diagnoses of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
age-matched-matched controls. In PD, the optical density (OD) of Nurr1 
immunofluorescence was significantly decreased in nigral neurons containing 
alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions. Similarly, the OD of Nurr1 
immunofluorescence intensity in the nigra of AD cases was decreased in neurons 
with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In contrast to PD and AD, the OD of Nurr1 
immunofluorescence intensity was severely decreased in the neurons with or 
without NFTs in PSP cases. Decline of Nurr1-ir neuronal number and OD was 
observed within substantia nigra (SN) neurons in PD but not within hippocampal 
neurons. The decline in Nurr1-ir expression was correlated with loss of tyrosine 
hydroxylase immunofluorescence across the four groups. These data demonstrate 
that Nurr1 deficiency in dopaminergic neurons is associated with the 
intracellular pathology in both synucleinopathies and tauopathies.

REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterised by nocturnal 
complex motor activity associated with dream mentation. RBD, which affects 
mainly older men, may be idiopathic or associated with other neurological 
disorders. A strong association between RBD and alpha-synucleinopathies has been 
recently observed, with the parasomnia often heralding the clinical onset of the 
neurodegenerative disease. The idiopathic form accounts for up to 60% of the 
cases reported in the three largest series of RBD patients. Follow-up studies in 
small samples revealed that a proportion of RBD patients will eventually develop 
Parkinson's disease and/or a dementia of Lewy bodies type in the years following 
the RBD diagnosis. Recently, neurophysiological and neuropsychological studies 
in idiopathic RBD have found evidence of central nervous system dysfunction. An 
impairment of cortical activity, specific neuropsychological deficits, signs of 
autonomic dysfunction and olfactory impairment have been observed in these 
patients, challenging the concept of idiopathic RBD. The detection of early 
markers of neurodegenerative disorders in idiopathic RBD, and the evaluation of 
their value by the combined application in prospective studies may be crucial 
for developing early intervention strategies.

population.

Allelic variation at the CYP2D6 gene has been suggested to be associated with 
CNS disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. In order to 
elucidate whether a relationship exists between CYP2D6 polymorphism and the risk 
of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), CYP2D6 allele and genotype frequencies 
have been evaluated in 94 patients from Southern Italy (29 men and 65 women, 
aged 74+/-8 years) with AD, and in 350 healthy controls (204 men, 146 women, 
aged 33+/-9 years) from the same geographical region. Allele frequencies among 
AD patients were not significantly different from those in healthy controls. 
Subjects could be divided in four CYP2D6 genotype groups: 52 (56%) patients and 
205 (59%) controls carried no mutated alleles (homozygous extensive metabolizers 
(EM)), 33 (35%) patients and 109 (31%) controls carried one mutated allele 
(heterozygous EM), while 4 (4%) patients and 11 (3%) controls were found to have 
two mutated alleles (poor metabolizers (PM)). Five (5%) patients and 25 (7%) 
controls carried extra copies of a functional gene (ultrarapid metabolizers 
(UM)). Our results indicate that CYP2D6 polymorphism is unlikely to represent a 
major risk factor in susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease.

Effects of Parkinson disease on two putative nondeclarative learning tasks: 
probabilistic classification and gambling.

Perretta JG(1), Pari G, Beninger RJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To assess performance on two nondeclarative (implicit) memory tasks 
of Parkinson disease (PD) patients without dementia in the earlier or later 
stages of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr Scale scores of 1-2.5 or 3-4, 
respectively).
BACKGROUND: Different subtypes of nondeclarative memory appear to depend on 
different components of frontostriatal circuitry. Performance on a probabilistic 
classification learning (PCL) task was impaired by striatal damage (eg, in PD or 
Huntington disease) but not by circumscribed frontal lobe damage. On the other 
hand, performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was impaired by damage to the 
prefrontal cortex.
METHOD AND RESULTS: On the PCL, the learning of the control (age- and 
education-matched) group (n = 19) and the early PD group (n = 16) was comparable 
with each other, and both groups showed better performance than the later PD 
group (n = 16). On the IGT, the control group learned better than both of the PD 
groups. The control and early PD groups were similar on measures from the 
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, and 
Beck Depression Inventory II.
CONCLUSIONS: The PCL and IGT tasks appear to rely on different parts of the 
frontostriatal circuitry in patients with early PD. The current finding that IGT 
performance was impaired in early PD implies ventromedial prefrontal cortical 
dysfunction early in the disease.

    Arch Neurol. 2005 Dec;62(12):1808.

BACKGROUND: Cases of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) with an autosomal 
dominant inheritance pattern (familial AD [FAD]) are rare but have greatly 
advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD. We describe 
herein a kindred with very early-onset FAD (age, <40 years) with unusual 
pathological features and a novel mutation in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene 
(S170F) and review the existing literature on very early-onset FAD.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the neuropathological and genetic features of a family 
with onset of AD in the third decade of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The proband underwent full clinical 
assessment and postmortem examination at the Washington University Alzheimer's 
Disease Research Center, St Louis, Mo. Limited pathological samples and autopsy 
records of 2 affected family members were available. The proband underwent 
screening for mutations in genes linked with FAD.
RESULTS: Dementia developed in 3 family members in this kindred at a mean age of 
27 years; the proband had myoclonus, seizures, and rigidity, similar to findings 
in previously described kindreds with PSEN1 mutations. All 3 family members were 
confirmed to have AD by neuropathological examination. The proband also had 
widespread Lewy body pathology in the brainstem, limbic areas, and neocortex; 
specific staining for Lewy bodies was not performed in the other 2 family 
members. The proband had a single mutation (S170F) in exon 6 of the PSEN1 gene, 
which segregates with disease.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel PSEN1 mutation causes very-early-onset FAD with associated 
Lewy bodies. To our knowledge, this kindred has the earliest reported onset of 
pathologically confirmed FAD and dementia with Lewy bodies.

[The role of environmental factors in Parkinson's disease may depend on disease 
onset age].

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Various factors are suspected to participate in PD onset 
and include environment-related factors and workplace exposure to pesticides, 
metals and hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, results of epidemiological research are 
inconsistent. Some authors emphasize hydrocarbons exposure to younger patients. 
Our aim was to compare PD risk factors to onset age.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of 174 patients with idiopathic PD, without dementia, two 
subgroups were isolated: 65 patients with early onset PD (EOPD) below 50 (n=65, 
age 52.8+/-7.6 years, onset 42.8+/-5.3 years) and 109 patients with late onset 
(LOPD) above 50 (n=109, age 67.8+/-7.0, onset 60.8+/-6.7 years). Various 
environmental factors reported in literature were analyzed.
RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that factors significantly predisposing 
to EOPD are vocational education (OR 3.24, 95%CI 1.50-7.00, p<0.003), smoking 
(OR 1.94, 95%CI 1.02-3.69, p<0.05), well water consumption at 20-40 (OR 2.77, 
95%CI 1.31-5.86, p<0.008), and after 40 (OR 4.84, 95%CI 1.95-11.99, p<0.0007), 
side-effects following exposure to paints (OR 2.26, 95%CI 1.10-4.66, p<0.03) and 
exposure to solvents (OR 1.98, 95%CI 0.96-4.07, p<0.07) on borderline 
significance. Drinking well water both between 20-40 and after 40 involved a 
substantial increase in EOPD (OR 6.57, 95%CI 2.43-17.75, p<0.0002). Education 
only at a primary level proved to be protective against EOPD (OR 0.20, 95%CI 
0.07-0.55, p<0.002). The multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated 
that independent EOPD risk factors are smoking (OR 2.20, 95%CI 1.07-4.53, 
p<0.04) and well water consumption both between 20-40 and after 40 (OR 8.29, 
95%CI 2.73-25.23, p<0.0002), whilst the independent protective factor is 
education only at a primary level (OR 0.17, 95%CI 0.05-0.53, p<0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated that a number of independent 
environmental factors significantly affect the risk of PD onset at younger ages. 
Presumably, some of the observed differences in the results of research of 
various authors into PD risk factors may be caused by ignoring onset age within 
the researched patients.

Café coronary syndrome-fatal choking on food: an autopsy approach.

Wick R(1), Gilbert JD, Byard RW.

Author information:
(1)Forensic Science SA and Department of Pathology, University of Adelaide, 21 
Divett Place, 5000 Adelaide, Australia.

To examine the characteristic features of fatal food asphyxia and to develop an 
autopsy approach to such cases a retrospective study of autopsy files was 
undertaken at Forensic Science SA (Adelaide, Australia) over a 10 year period 
from 1993 to 2002 for all cases of food asphyxia/café coronary syndrome. 
Forty-four cases were identified (M;F=21:23), with one infant (11 mths) and 43 
adults (30-96 yrs; mean 68.9 yrs), with a preponderance of victims (57%) aged 
between 71 and 90 yrs. Deaths occurred in nursing homes (N=22) cases, at home 
(N=11) and in restaurants (N=4). Twenty-seven of the victims (61%) had histories 
of neurological or psychiatric disorders such as dementia (N=8), schizophrenia 
(N=6), Alzheimer disease (N=4), atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (N=4), 
mental impairment (N=2), multiple sclerosis (N=1), Parkinson disease (N=1) and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (N=1). Twenty-seven cases (61%) were described as 
either edentulous or having significant numbers of teeth missing. Toxicological 
evaluation of blood revealed alcohol and a variety of psychotropic prescription 
medications in 19 cases. Sudden collapse during or shortly after a meal should 
always raise the possibility of café coronary and the autopsy examination should 
not only attempt to demonstrate airway occlusion by a bolus of food, but also to 
identify or exclude underlying neurological disease. Such cases may raise issues 
concerning adequacy of care and appropriateness of medication. The diagnosis of 
café coronary syndrome can only be made with confidence after the clinical 
history and circumstances of death have been clearly established, impacted 
material has been demonstrated in the airway at autopsy (or recorded by those 
attempting resuscitation), risk factors have been identified and other possible 
causes of death have been excluded.

Clinical heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein gene duplication in Parkinson's 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, genomic multiplications of alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) have 
been reported to cause hereditary early-onset parkinsonism. The objective of 
this study was to assess the frequency of SNCA multiplications among autosomal 
dominant hereditary Parkinson's disease (ADPD).
METHODS: We screened 113 ADPD probands and 200 sporadic PD cases by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and confirmed SNCA multiplications by fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization array.
RESULTS: Two families (two patients from Family A and one from Family B) with 
SNCA duplication were identified among ADPD patients. Even though they had the 
same SNCA duplication, one patient had dementia. Because there was exactly the 
same difference between the regions originated from each patient, the finding 
suggests that the phenotype of SNCA multiplication may be also influenced by the 
range of duplication region. We also detected asymptomatic carriers in the 
families of both patients. Interestingly, the penetrance ratio was 33.3% (2/6) 
in one kindred, indicating that the ratio was very much lower than expected.
INTERPRETATION: These two newly identified Japanese patients with SNCA 
duplication and the five previously identified American and European families 
with SNCA triplication or duplication mutations indicate that the incidence of 
SNCA multiplication may be more frequent than previously estimated.

Apolipoprotein epsilon4 advances appearance of psychosis in patients with 
Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: Psychosis is one of the most serious complications of advanced 
parkinsonism, but many patients are spared. The genetic factors predisposing to 
psychosis are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
polymorphism and the development of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD).
METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with advanced PD were assessed. Psychosis was 
diagnosed in 50 patients who manifested paranoid delusions, hallucinations 
without insight, or disorders of perception. Time of onset of psychosis was 
retrieved from the medical records and caregivers' recall. APOE genotype was 
determined by restriction enzyme digests of amplified alleles. Cox models of 
logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess factors 
determining early development of psychosis.
RESULTS: APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 allele was carried by 20 patients (14 with 
psychosis), epsilon2/epsilon3 by 11 patients (10 with psychosis), 
epsilon3/epsilon3 by 55 patients (25 with psychosis) and epsilon2/epsilon4 by 
one patient who had psychosis. The mean age of onset of PD symptoms was 60.0 +/- 
12.5 years. The mean duration of motor symptoms at the onset of psychosis was 
7.3 +/- 4.3 years for the 15 patients harboring an APOE epsilon4 allele and 10.1 
+/- 6.2 years among those who did not carry APOE epsilon4 (n = 35). The APOE 
epsilon4 allele was significantly associated with earlier onset of psychosis (P 
< 0.05) when the age of onset of motor symptoms and presence of dementia were 
included in the Cox regression model. Carrying the APOE epsilon4 allele was a 
significant risk factor for earlier appearance of psychosis with a hazard ratio 
of 3.24 (95% CI 1.62-6.46) while dementia by itself did not increase the risk.
CONCLUSION: Parkinson's disease patients who carry the APOE epsilon4 allele 
develop psychosis earlier.

Broadening a classic clinical triad: The hypokinetic motor disorder of normal 
pressure hydrocephalus also affects the hand.

The clinical spectrum of normal pressure hydrocephalus is thought to comprise 
the triad of hypokinetic gait disorder, dementia and urinary incontinence. In 
contrast, motor abnormalities involving the upper limbs in normal pressure 
hydrocephalus have not yet received a great deal of attention. The present study 
was designed to quantitatively assess grasping movements in normal pressure 
hydrocephalus and to compare the performance with that in Parkinson's disease. 
Eight subjects with normal pressure hydrocephalus, eight subjects with 
Parkinson's disease and eight healthy control subjects grasped to lift an 
instrumented object. The built-up of fingertip forces during the early phase and 
the kinematics of the lifting movement during the late phase of the grip-lift 
synergy were slower for patients compared to healthy controls. Patients 
generated abnormally high fingertip forces when lifting and holding the object 
stationary. The slowness of the grip-lift synergy and the force overshoot was 
similar for both patient groups. Our data demonstrate that the hypokinetic motor 
deficit in normal pressure hydrocephalus also involves the hand, and that the 
pattern of deficits shares several features of those found in Parkinson's 
disease.

The LDLR locus in Alzheimer's disease: a family-based study and meta-analysis of 
case-control data.

Genetic linkage studies suggest the presence of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk 
gene on chromosome 19, acting independently of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a known 
AD risk factor on 19q13. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is an 
interesting candidate because it maps within the linked interval, and is 
intimately involved in cholesterol homeostasis and the function of apoE. We 
tested three previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 
LDLR in a large sample of discordant sibships from multiplex AD families, and 
failed to find evidence for genetic association with disease risk. In addition, 
we performed meta-analyses for SNP rs5925 on published data from five 
independent case control samples, but did not detect any significant summary 
odds ratios. Based on our data, it seems unlikely that these genetic variants in 
LDLR make a significant contribution to AD risk in the general population.

    Neurology. 2006 Jul 11;67(1):182-3; author reply 182-3.

BACKGROUND: Parkinsonian signs such as gait disturbance, rigidity, bradykinesia, 
and tremor are common among individuals with dementia and are associated with 
negative outcomes, but little is known about parkinsonian signs among 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which MCI is associated with parkinsonian 
signs and the relation between cognitive abilities and parkinsonism among 
individuals with MCI.
METHODS: Participants included 835 individuals from the Rush Memory and Aging 
Project, a clinical-pathologic study of common chronic conditions of old age. 
All participants underwent detailed clinical evaluations which included 
assessments of parkinsonian signs and cognitive function, and linear regression 
models were used to examine the associations of MCI and parkinsonism.
RESULTS: In a series of analyses controlled for age, sex, and education, 
individuals with MCI exhibited significantly more parkinsonism than individuals 
without cognitive impairment, particularly gait disturbance, bradykinesia, and 
rigidity. Among individuals with MCI, lower levels of cognitive function, 
particularly in perceptual speed, were associated with higher levels of 
parkinsonism; when classified according to MCI subtype, individuals with 
amnestic vs non-amnestic MCI differed from each other on only one parkinsonian 
sign, with non-amnestic MCI showing more gait disturbance. Because vascular 
factors can contribute to cognitive impairment and parkinsonian signs, the 
authors repeated the core analyses including terms for vascular risk factors and 
vascular disease and the associations between MCI and parkinsonism persisted.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is accompanied by parkinsonian 
signs, which are related to the severity and type of cognitive impairment. The 
association between MCI and parkinsonism is not explained by vascular risk 
factors or vascular disease.

Early cognitive changes and nondementing behavioral abnormalities in Parkinson's 
disease.

Levin BE(1), Katzen HL.

Author information:

Florida, USA.

Early cognitive changes in patients with PD are often subtle and influenced by 
factors that interact with the disease process, including age of disease onset, 
medication, and the specific constellation of motor symptoms. These factors 
notwithstanding, ample evidence exists that specific cognitive changes occur 
early in the course of PD. This evidence does not imply that cognitive deficits 
are pervasive during the early stages. To the contrary, they are usually subtle 
and often difficult to detect without formal neuropsychological testing. 
Executive-function deficits are the most frequently reported cognitive problems 
and, given that executive skills are an integral part of many tasks, it follows 
that subtle difficulties may be seen on a wide range of cognitive measures, 
particularly in working memory and visuospatial dysfunction, two areas that rely 
heavily on executive skills. Whereas apraxia and language processing deficits 
occur infrequently, subtle changes in olfaction and contrast sensitivity have 
also been repeatedly observed. Finally, depressive symptoms are also common in 
the early stages of the disease. The significance of the early behavioral 
changes and their prognostic implications are largely unknown. Prospective 
studies are needed to understand the longitudinal course of early cognitive 
changes to determine whether they remain as circumscribed impairments or 
represent a precursor to a more widespread dementia.

Dementia in Parkinson's disease.

Rippon GA(1), Marder KS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Dementia as a manifestation of idiopathic PD is an important feature of the 
disease in terms of QOL, prognosis, and clinical management. The pathophysiology 
of the disorder is likely a multifactorial process that encompasses derangement 
of multiple neuronal populations of both subcortical and cortical origin. This 
process results in a cognitive profile that largely reflects a dysexecutive 
syndrome. Currently, treatment of PDD is symptomatic. Further research is needed 
to elucidate the relationship of PDD to DLB and AD in hopes of developing and 
using appropriate therapeutic measures designed to address the underlying 
disease process.

Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes following sub-acute exposure to manganese 
and its prevention by antioxidant treatment.

Exposure to manganese in an industrial or clinical setting can lead to 
manganism, a neurological disorder with similarities to Parkinson's disease. 
Although the pathogenetic basis of this disorder is unclear, studies indicate 
this metal is highly accumulated in astrocytes, suggesting an involvement of 
these glial cells. To investigate this issue, we have used a recently 
characterized, sub-acute model of manganese neurotoxicity. Treatment of rats 
with manganese (II) chloride (50 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) once daily for 1 or 4 
days led to increases in manganese levels of up to 232, 523, and 427% in the 
cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, and cerebellum, respectively, by instrumental 
neutron activation analysis. These changes were accompanied by development of 
pathological changes in glial morphology identified as Alzheimer type II 
astrocytosis in both cortical and sub-cortical structures. Co-treatment with 
either the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or the manganese chelator 
1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid completely blocked this pathology, 
indicating the cellular transformation may be mediated by oxidative stress 
associated with the presence of this metal. These findings represent, to our 
knowledge, the first report of early induction of this pathological hallmark of 
manganese neurotoxicity, an event previously considered a consequence of chronic 
exposure to manganese in primates and in human cases of manganism. Our results 
also indicate that use of this rodent model may provide a novel opportunity to 
examine the nature and role of the Alzheimer type II astrocyte in the 
pathophysiology of this disorder as well as in other disease processes in which 
cerebral accumulation of manganese occurs.

Functional brain imaging: an evidence-based analysis.

Medical Advisory Secretariat.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis is to review a spectrum of functional 
brain imaging technologies to identify whether there are any imaging modalities 
that are more effective than others for various brain pathology conditions. This 
evidence-based analysis reviews magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) for the diagnosis or surgical management of the 
following conditions: Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain tumours, epilepsy, 
multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD).
CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Alzheimer's disease is a 
progressive, degenerative, neurologic condition characterized by cognitive 
impairment and memory loss. The Canadian Study on Health and Aging estimated 
that there will be 97,000 incident cases (about 60,000 women) of dementia 
(including AD) in Canada in 2006. In Ontario, there will be an estimated 950 new 
cases and 580 deaths due to brain cancer in 2006. Treatments for brain tumours 
include surgery and radiation therapy. However, one of the limitations of 
radiation therapy is that it damages tissue though necrosis and scarring. 
Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not 
distinguish between radiation effects and resistant tissue, creating a potential 
role for functional brain imaging. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that provokes 
repetitive seizures. In Ontario, the rate of epilepsy is estimated to be 5 cases 
per 1,000 people. Most people with epilepsy are effectively managed with drug 
therapy; but about 50% do not respond to drug therapy. Surgical resection of the 
seizure foci may be considered in these patients, and functional brain imaging 
may play a role in localizing the seizure foci. Multiple sclerosis is a 
progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
(CNS). The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is thought to be due to a 
combination of etiologies, including genetic and environmental components. The 
prevalence of MS in Canada is 240 cases per 100,000 people. Parkinson's disease 
is the most prevalent movement disorder; it affects an estimated 100,000 
Canadians. Currently, the standard for measuring disease progression is through 
the use of scales, which are subjective measures of disease progression. 
Functional brain imaging may provide an objective measure of disease 
progression, differentiation between parkinsonian syndromes, and response to 
therapy.
THE TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGING: Functional brain 
imaging technologies measure blood flow and metabolism. The results of these 
tests are often used in conjunction with structural imaging (e.g., MRI or CT). 
Positron emission tomography and MRS identify abnormalities in brain tissues. 
The former measures abnormalities through uptake of radiotracers in the brain, 
while the latter measures chemical shifts in metabolite ratios to identify 
abnormalities. The potential role of functional MRI (fMRI) is to identify the 
areas of the brain responsible for language, sensory and motor function 
(sensorimotor cortex), rather than identifying abnormalities in tissues. 
Magnetoencephalography measures magnetic fields of the electric currents in the 
brain, identifying aberrant activity. Magnetoencephalography may have the 
potential to localize seizure foci and to identify the sensorimotor cortex, 
visual cortex and auditory cortex. In terms of regulatory status, MEG and PET 
are licensed by Health Canada. Both MRS and fMRI use a MRI platform; thus, they 
do not have a separate licence from Health Canada. The radiotracers used in PET 
scanning are not licensed by Health Canada for general use but can be used 
through a Clinical Trials Application.
REVIEW STRATEGY: The literature published up to September 2006 was searched in 
the following databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed 
Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, and 
International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). The 
database search was supplemented with a search of relevant Web sites and a 
review of the bibliographies of selected papers. General inclusion criteria were 
applied to all conditions. Those criteria included the following: Full reports 
of systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort-control 
studies, prospective cohort studies (PCS'), and retrospective studies.Sample 
sizes of at least 20 patients (≥ 10 with condition being 
reviewed).English-language studies.Human studies.Any age.STUDYING AT LEAST ONE 
OF THE FOLLOWING: fMRI, PET, MRS, or MEG.Functional brain imaging modality must 
be compared with a clearly defined reference standard.MUST REPORT AT LEAST ONE 
OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive 
predictive value (PPV), receiver operating characteristic curve, outcome 
measuring impact on diagnostic testing, treatment, patient health, or cost.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: There is evidence to indicate that PET can accurately 
diagnose AD; however, at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that a 
diagnosis of AD with PET alters the clinical outcomes of patients. The addition 
of MRS or O-(2-(18)F-Fluoroethyl)-L-Tyrosine (FET)-PET to gadolinium 
(Gd)-enhanced MRI for distinguishing malignant from benign tumours during 
primary diagnosis may provide a higher specificity than Gd-enhanced MRI alone. 
The clinical utility of additional imaging in patients to distinguish malignant 
from benign tumours is unclear, because patients with a suspected brain tumour 
will likely undergo a biopsy despite additional imaging results. The addition of 
MRS, FET-PET, or MRI T2 to Gd-enhanced MRI for the differentiation of recurrence 
from radiation necrosis may provide a higher specificity than Gd-enhanced MRI 
alone. The clinical utility of additional imaging in patients with a suspected 
recurrence is in the monitoring of patients. Based on the evidence available, it 
is unclear if one of the imaging modalities (MRS, FET-PET, or MRI T2) offers 
significantly improved specificity over another. There may be a role for fMRI in 
the identification of surgical candidates for tumour resection; however, this 
requires further research. Based on the studies available, it is unclear if MEG 
has similar accuracy in localizing seizure foci to intracranial 
electroencephalogram (ICEEG). More high-quality research is needed to establish 
whether there is a difference in accuracy between MEG and ICEEG. The results of 
the studies comparing PET to noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) did not 
demonstrate that PET was more accurate at localizing seizure foci; however, 
there may be some specific conditions, such as tuberous sclerosis, where PET may 
be more accurate than noninvasive EEG. There may be some clinical utility for 
MEG or fMRI in presurgical functional mapping; however, this needs further 
investigation involving comparisons with other modalities. The clinical utility 
of MRS has yet to be established for patients with epilepsy. Positron emission 
tomography has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PD and the 
differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes; however, it is unclear at this 
time if the addition of PET in the diagnosis of these conditions contributes to 
the treatment and clinical outcomes of patients. There is limited clinical 
utility of functional brain imaging in the management of patients with MS at 
this time. Diagnosis of MS is established through clinical history, evoked 
potentials, and MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging can identify the multifocal 
white lesions and other structural characteristics of MS.

OBJECTIVE: To obtain a profile of the causes and clinical characteristics of 
cognitive disorders in patients referred to a memory clinic before the age of 65 
years.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-note study.
METHOD: Data were collected from 127 subjects with objective cognitive disorders 
who visited the Alzheimer Centre of the VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands, in the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003 with an onset 
of complaints before the age of 65. Besides the diagnoses, we investigated the 
clinical presentations, the occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors, the 
family history, and the presence of noncognitive neurological signs.
RESULTS: The most common causes of cognitive decline under the age of 65 were 
Alzheimer's disease (46%) and frontotemporal dementia (23%). Vascular dementia 
was seen in 5% and dementia with Lewy bodies in 2%; 9% had mild cognitive 
impairment but no dementia. Hypertension and a positive family history for 
dementia were each present in 40% of the patients. Non-cognitive neurological 
abnormalities were found only in cases of non-Alzheimer dementia. During the 
period under investigation, the number of patients with objective cognitive 
disorders increased more than did the number without a cognitive disorder.
CONCLUSION: Within the population of a memory clinic, Alzheimer's disease was 
the most frequent cause of cognitive decline under the age of 65, followed by 
frontotemporal dementia. The distribution differed from causes of dementia at an 
older age, where vascular dementia had the second place.

Baltimore, MD, USA.

Parkinsonism is a common, age-related syndrome, characterized by resting tremor, 
bradykinesias, rigidity, and postural reflex impairment. Though Parkinsonism is 
not very difficult to recognize, all Parkinsonism is not created equal and it is 
important to distinguish among the most common identifiable syndromes. This 
review discusses the key clinical features of these various syndromes, including 
Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, 
corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular Parkinsonism, 
and Parkinsonism with no clear etiology. Symptomatology and diagnostic testing 
for each syndrome are discussed and 4 typical cases are analyzed to offer 
clinicians guidance in making a differential diagnosis for Parkinsonism.

What best differentiates Lewy body from Alzheimer's disease in early-stage 
dementia?

Italy.

To determine which clinical feature(s) [among visual hallucinations (VH), 
extrapyramidal signs (EPS) and visuospatial impairment] in the earliest stages 
of disease best predicted a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) at 
autopsy, first-visit data of 23 pathologically proven DLB and 94 Alzheimer's 
disease cases were compared. There were no group differences with regard to age, 
gender, education or global severity of dementia at presentation (mean 
Mini-Mental State Examination: 24.0 versus 25.0, mean Dementia Rating Scale: 
123.6 versus 125.7). DLB patients at initial presentation displayed an increased 
frequency of VH (P = 0.001), but not EPS (P = 0.3), compared to Alzheimer's 
disease patients. However, only a minority of DLB cases had either VH (22%), EPS 
(26%) or both (13%). In contrast, although not a core feature, 
visuospatial/constructional impairment was observed in most of the DLB cases 
(74%). Among clinical variables, presence/recent history of VH was the most 
specific to DLB (99%), and visuospatial impairment was the most sensitive (74%). 
As a result, VH at presentation were the best positive predictor of DLB at 
autopsy (positive predictive value: 83% versus 32% or less for all other 
variables), while lack of visuospatial impairment was the best negative 
predictor (negative predictive value: 90%). We conclude that the best model for 
differentiating DLB from Alzheimer's disease in the earliest stages of disease 
includes VH and visuospatial/constructional dysfunction, but not spontaneous 
EPS, as predictors. This suggests that clinical history plus a brief assessment 
of visuospatial function may be of the greatest value in correctly identifying 
DLB early during the course of disease.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Neuronal degeneration and dopamine loss in the preclinical phase of 
Parkinson disease may produce subtle complaints before clinically recognizable 
symptoms emerge.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether subjective complaints of stiffness, slowness, 
tremors, or postural imbalance in persons without clinical signs of parkinsonism 
are related to an increased risk of future Parkinson disease.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. We recorded subjective complaints of 
stiffness, slowness of movement, tremors, falling, or a feeling of imbalance in 
a standardized interview of 6038 participants without dementia in whom no 
parkinsonian signs were found on physical examination at baseline, and we 
studied them prospectively for the occurrence of incident Parkinson disease.
SETTING: General population.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6038 participants who were free of dementia and 
parkinsonian signs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident Parkinson disease. Participants were examined in 
person both at baseline (January 1990-June 1993) and at 2 follow-up visits 
(September 1993-December 1994 and April 1997-December 1999), and the cohort was 
continuously monitored through computerized linkage of the study database to 
general practitioners' medical records. We analyzed the data using Cox 
proportional hazards regression models.
RESULTS: Participants who reported stiffness, tremors, or imbalance at baseline 
had a significantly increased risk of developing Parkinson disease during 
follow-up (for stiffness, hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 
1.25-3.55; P = .005; for tremors, hazard ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 
1.12-3.90; P = .002; and for imbalance, hazard ratio, 3.47; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.69-7.00; P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjective complaints of stiffness, tremors, and imbalance are 
associated with an increased risk of future Parkinson disease and may reflect 
early effects of dopamine shortage, even when standard neurological testing 
cannot yet demonstrate any motor symptoms.

Whether chronic hallucinations belong to the natural history of untreated 
Parkinson disease (PD) remains undetermined. For early authors such as Gowers or 
Charcot and his followers, hallucinations that occurred in the course of PD 
either accompanied the final phase of the disease or reflected comorbidities. 
However, a few authors observed that hallucinations could occur in PD patients 
with severe depression, confusion, or dementia. Interest in hallucinations with 
parkinsonism increased with the outbreak of von Economo encephalitis, as they 
were more frequent than in PD, provoking new pathophysiologic questions. Later 
studies on mental symptoms in parkinsonism were often based on series that 
pooled patients with PD and postencephalitic syndromes, confounding a clear 
analysis. It remains difficult to estimate the prevalence of hallucinations in 
the natural course of PD before the introduction of levodopa therapy. The lack 
of prospective studies, the wide early use of anticholinergics and ergots 
compounds, and the absence of dementia with Lewy bodies in the nosology of the 
time are further limitations. Even with these limitations, historical 
descriptions of PD from the prelevodopa era suggest that hallucinations may be 
part of PD itself, especially in the context of late dementia, depression, or 
nonspecific encephalopathy.

Risk factors for incident dementia in England and Wales: The Medical Research 
Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. A population-based nested 
case-control study.

Cambridge, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate a number of prospectively collected factors 
(sociodemographic, medical and behavioural) and their association with incident 
dementia in a population-based cohort.
DESIGN: Nested case-control analysis (at 2 and 6 years) of a population-based 
cohort study.
SETTING: Individuals aged 65 years and above from five centres in England and 
Wales: two rural (Cambridgeshire and Gwynedd) and three urban (Nottingham, 
Newcastle and Oxford).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4,075 individuals from a detailed assessment group, 
with risk measured at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident dementia at 2 and 6 years.
METHODS: Logistic regression was used to calculate crude odds ratios (ORs) for 
various risk factors and ORs adjusted for age, sex, education and social class.
RESULTS: Age (90+ versus 65-69 years OR = 25.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
11.6-56.9) and sex (women versus men OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.4) were directly 
associated with dementia, with a trend by years of education (P(trend) = 0.02) 
but not social class. Poor self-perceived health (versus good) increased the 
risk for incident dementia (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 2.2-6.9). Alcohol and smoking 
(never, past and current) were neither strongly protective nor predictive. 
Stroke was strongly related to incident dementia (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1-4.2), 
as was Parkinson's disease (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.3-9.3), and exposure to general 
anaesthesia (GA) was inversely associated with dementia development (OR = 0.6, 
95% CI = 0.4-0.9, with a trend with increasing GA exposure; P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: In this large multicentre and long-term population-based study, some 
well-known risk factors for dementia, of vascular and Alzheimer's type, are 
confirmed but not others. The association between self-perceived health-a robust 
predictor of later health outcomes-and incident dementia, independently of other 
potential risks, warrants further study.

The deposition of alpha-synuclein (aS), a product of pathogenic gene for 
dominantly inherited familial Parkinson's disease (PD; park1), as fibrillary 
aggregates like Lewy bodies (LB), is a hallmark lesion of a set of 
neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, including sporadic PD and 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We found that aS is the major component of LBs 
and further identified a specific phosphorylation of Ser129 of insoluble aS by 
mass spectrometric analysis. The roles of DJ-1 and PINK-1, products of 
pathogenic genes for autosomal recessive forms of early-onset parkinsonism, have 
subsequently been examined. Overexpression of DJ-1 conferred cultured cells 
resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting an antioxidant function of DJ-1. We 
also confirmed the anti-PTEN function of DJ-1 that may promote cell survival, 
showing decreased phosphorylation of Akt through upregulation of PTEN activity 
upon siRNA knockdown for DJ-1. PINK-1, that had been identified as a gene 
upregulated by PTEN overexpression, turned out to be a protein kinase localized 
in mitochondria. Collectively, information derived from studies on pathogenic 
genes for familial PD will open up the way toward the clarification of the 
pathogenesis of PD, underscoring the roles of protein aggregation, proteolysis, 
oxidative stress and protein phosphorylation in PD.

population-based sample of elderly subjects: the Italian Longitudinal Study on 
Aging.

Geriatrics, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.

OBJECTIVES: To examine risk and predictors of motor-performance (MP) decline 
targeting subjects performing normally at an initial observation.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: A subsample of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (aged 65-84).
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand fifty-two subjects (mean age+/-standard deviation = 
71+/-5, 69% men) with normal MP at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Six tests (standing up from a chair, stepping up, tandem walk, 
standing on one leg, walking speed, and steps turning 180 degrees ) were used to 
assess MP at baseline and after 3 years. Baseline characteristics were potential 
predictors of MP decline.
RESULTS: Of the 1,052 subjects performing normally at baseline, 166 (15.8%) had 
declined in MP at follow-up. Older age, female sex, lower education, symptoms of 
distal symmetrical neuropathy, cognitive impairment without dementia, 
parkinsonism, heart failure, anemia, depressive symptoms, worse Mini-Mental 
State Examination score, and lost activities of daily living and instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADLs) were significantly associated with MP decline 
in univariate comparisons. Older age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.84, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) = 2.14-6.88 comparing age classes > or =80 with 65-69), female sex 
(OR=1.50, 95% CI = 1.03-2.20), distal symmetric neuropathy (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 
1.03-3.87), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.17-2.24), and baseline 
IADLs (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.08-1.37 for each lost activity) independently 
predicted MP decline after regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: In a population-based cohort of elderly people with normal MP, 
one-sixth declined in 3 years. Age, sex, distal symmetrical neuropathy, 
depressive symptoms, and baseline IADLs independently predicted this decline. 
Distal symmetrical neuropathy is underestimated in the clinical and 
epidemiological evaluation of motor decline in older people.

Dementia lacking distinct histopathological features (DLDHF) belongs to the 
frontotemporal dementia syndromes. Behavioral, cognitive and motor symptoms are 
its usual clinical manifestations. However, considerable heterogeneity exists 
and no evident clinicopathological correlations can be performed. We report a 
patient who presented with a very unusual combination of behavioral 
abnormalities and prominent early parkinsonism progressing to a severe dementia. 
Pathological studies confirmed DLDHF with severe frontal and striatal neuronal 
loss and gliosis.

Late-life depression refers to depressive syndromes defined in the American 
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and in the 
International Classification of Diseases that arise in adults older than 65 
years of age. Late life depressive syndromes often arise in the context of 
medical and neurologic disorders. There is a high prevalence of depression in 
various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body 
disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease and frontotemporal 
dementias. It has been well recognized that late life depression may itself be 
the presenting symptom of a latent neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, an 
accurate diagnosis of late-onset depression may serve to identify a high-risk 
group that would benefit from initiation of therapies with the goal of delaying 
or possibly even preventing the onset of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites are frequent concomitant 
neuropathologic observations in clinical and neuropathologically defined 
Alzheimer disease (AD), but their relation to clinical features in AD is 
uncertain. Most studies used semiquantitative measures to determine the presence 
or absence of LB abnormalities.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical consequences of LB abnormalities in the 
setting of AD.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Three outpatient research and treatment centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen autopsy cases with a pathologic diagnosis of AD 
abnormalities and concomitant LBs followed semiannually for up to 8 years (mean 
age at intake, 72 years; mean age at death, 77 years; mean education, 15 years; 
12 women).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The modified Mini-Mental State Examination was used to 
assess cognitive function. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale was used 
to rate extrapyramidal motor signs. Hallucinations were evaluated using the 
Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease. Time from 
the first evaluation in which diagnostic criteria for probable AD were met to 
death was used to determine illness duration. Quantitative measures of LB 
abnormalities were obtained for the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, 
substantia nigra, and hippocampus.
RESULTS: Independent-samples t tests were used to assess whether the degree of 
LB abnormality varied as a function of the presence or absence of hallucinations 
and extrapyramidal signs. Pearson r correlations were run to examine whether 
there was a relation among LB abnormalities, cognitive function, and illness 
duration. There was no relation between quantitative neuropathologic indexes of 
LB abnormalities and clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION: The variability of clinical features in AD was not related to the 
presence or degree of LB abnormalities.

Primary progressive freezing gait: a syndrome with many causes.

Factor SA(1), Higgins DS, Qian J.

Author information:

30329, USA. sfactor@emory.edu

Primary progressive freezing gait (PPFG) is characterized by early gait freezing 
and a stereotyped progression. Of nine patients followed up for 6 to 16 years, 
two were diagnosed pathologically: pallidonigroluysian degeneration (PNLD) and 
diffuse Lewy body disease. Four others evolved clinically into progressive 
supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. PPFG is not a distinct 
disorder but a syndrome with diverse causes. Long-term follow-up (> or =10 
years) and postmortem are required for accurate diagnosis. PNLD may be the 
primary form of disease.

To date there is no accepted clinical diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease 
(PD) based on biochemical analysis of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) protein has been linked to the pathogenesis of PD 
with the discovery of mutations in the gene encoding alpha-syn in familial cases 
with early-onset PD. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which constitute the main 
pathological features in the brains of patients with sporadic PD and dementia 
with Lewy bodies, are formed by the conversion of soluble monomers of alpha-syn 
into insoluble aggregates. We recently reported the presence of alpha-syn in 
normal human blood plasma and in postmortem CSF. Here, we investigated whether 
alpha-syn can be used as a biomarker for PD. We have developed a novel ELISA 
method that detects only oligomeric "soluble aggregates" of alpha-syn. Using 
this ELISA, we report the presence of significantly elevated (P=0.002) levels of 
oligomeric forms of alpha-syn in plasma samples obtained from 34 PD patients 
compared with 27 controls; 52% (95% confidence intervals 0.353-0.687) of the PD 
patients displayed signals >0.5 OD with our ELISA assay in comparison to only 
14.8% (95% confidence intervals 0.014-0.281) for the control cases. An analysis 
of the test's diagnostic value revealed a specificity of 0.852 (95% confidence 
intervals 0.662-0.958), sensitivity of 0.529 (95% confidence intervals 
0.351-0.702) and a positive predictive value of 0.818 (95% confidence intervals 
0.597-0.948). These observations offer new opportunities for developing 
diagnostic tests for PD and related diseases and for testing therapeutic agents 
aimed at preventing or reversing the aggregation of alpha-syn.
