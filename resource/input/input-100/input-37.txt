In the molecular era, the study of neurogenetic disorders in relict populations 
provides an opportunity to discover new genes by linkage studies and to 
establish clearer genotype-phenotype correlations in large cohorts of 
individuals carrying the same mutation. The Basque people are one of the most 
ancient populations living in Europe and represent an excellent resource for 
this type of analysis in certain genetic conditions. Our objective was to 
describe neurogenetic disorders reported in the Basque population due to the 
presence of ancestral mutations or an accumulation of cases or both. We 
conducted a search in PubMed with the terms: Basque, neurogenetic disorders, 
genetic risk, and neurological disorders. We identified nine autosomal and two 
recessive disorders in the Basque population attributable to ancestral mutations 
(such as in PNRP, PARK8, FTDP-TDP43, LGMD2A, VCP, c9ORF72, and CMT4A), highly 
prevalent (DM1) or involving unique mutations (PARK1 or MAPT). Other genes were 
reported for their role as protective/risk factors in complex diseases such as 
multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. At the present 
time, when powerful sequencing techniques are identifying large numbers of 
genetic variants associated with unique phenotypes, the scrutiny of these 
findings in genetically homogeneous populations can help analyze 
genotype-phenotype correlations.

Sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment are common non-motor manifestations 
of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that sleep spindles and slow 
waves play a role in brain plasticity mechanisms and are associated with 
cognitive performance. However, it remains unknown whether these sleep 
parameters could serve as markers of cognitive decline in PD. Therefore, we 
examined whether alterations in sleep spindles and slow waves at baseline visit 
were associated with increased likelihood of developing dementia at follow-up in 
PD. Sixty-eight nondemented PD patients (64.9 ± 8.8 years old; 46 men) 
participated in the study, along with 47 healthy individuals (65.0 ± 10.6 years 
old; 30 men). All participants underwent baseline polysomnographic recording and 
a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Sleep spindles (12-15 Hz) and 
slow waves (>75 μV and <4 Hz) were automatically detected on all-night non-rapid 
eye movement sleep electroencephalography. At follow-up (mean: 4.5 years later), 
18 PD patients developed dementia (70.2 ± 7.6 years old; 13 men) and 50 remained 
dementia-free (63.0 ± 8.5 years old; 33 men). Sleep spindle density and 
amplitude were lower in PD patients who converted to dementia compared with both 
patients who remained dementia-free and controls, mostly in posterior cortical 
regions (p < 0.05). Dementia-free PD patients were intermediate between dementia 
patients and controls, with lower baseline sleep spindle density in all cortical 
areas compared with controls (p < 0.01). In demented PD patients, lower sleep 
spindle amplitude in parietal and occipital areas was associated with poorer 
visuospatial abilities. Although slow wave amplitude was lower in PD patients 
compared with controls (p < 0.0001), no difference was observed between those 
who developed or did not develop dementia. Results demonstrate non-rapid eye 
movement sleep electroencephalographic abnormalities in PD patients. Sleep 
spindle activity was particularly impaired in PD patients who developed 
dementia, with a more posterior topographic pattern. Sleep spindle alterations 
are associated with later development of dementia in PD, and thus may serve as 
an additional marker of cognitive decline in these patients.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are very common in neurodegenerative diseases 
and are a major contributor to disability and caregiver burden. There is 
accumulating evidence that NPS may be a prodrome and/or a "risk factor" of 
neurodegenerative diseases. The medications used to treat these symptoms in 
younger patients are not very effective in patients with neurodegenerative 
disease and may have serious side effects. An understanding of the neurobiology 
of NPS is critical for the development of more effective intervention 
strategies. Targeting these symptoms may also have implications for prevention 
of cognitive or motor decline. Molecular brain imaging represents a bridge 
between basic and clinical observations and provides many opportunities for 
translation from animal models and human post-mortem studies to in vivo human 
studies. Molecular brain imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD) are reviewed with a primary focus on positron emission 
tomography studies of NPS. Future directions for the field of molecular imaging 
in AD and PD to understand the neurobiology of NPS will be discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies often co-exist. Several 
studies suggest a synergistic relationship between amyloid-β (Aβ) and 
α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation. We have explored the relationship between Aβ 
accumulation and the phosphorylation of α-syn at serine-129 (pSer129 α-syn), in 
post-mortem human brain tissue and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected to 
overexpress human α-syn.
METHODS: We measured levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, α-syn and pSer129 α-syn by sandwich 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in soluble and insoluble fractions of 
midfrontal, cingulate and parahippocampal cortex and thalamus, from cases of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) with (PDD; n = 12) and without dementia (PDND; n = 23), 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 17). We 
also examined the relationship of these measurements to cognitive decline, as 
measured by time-to-dementia and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score 
in the PD patients, and to Braak tangle stage.
RESULTS: In most brain regions, the concentration of insoluble pSer129 α-syn 
correlated positively, and soluble pSer129 α-syn negatively, with the levels of 
soluble and insoluble Aβ. Insoluble pSer129 α-syn also correlated positively 
with Braak stage. In most regions, the levels of insoluble and soluble Aβ and 
the proportion of insoluble α-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 were 
significantly higher in the PD and DLB groups than the controls, and higher in 
the PDD and DLB groups than the PDND brains. In PD, the MMSE score correlated 
negatively with the level of insoluble pSer129 α-syn. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells 
to aggregated Aβ42 significantly increased the proportion of α-syn that was 
phosphorylated at Ser129 (aggregated Aβ40 exposure had a smaller, 
non-significant effect).
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that the concentration of pSer129 α-syn 
in brain tissue homogenates is directly related to the level of Aβ and Braak 
tangle stage, and predicts cognitive status in Lewy body diseases.

BACKGROUND: Swallowing disturbances are an important issue in Parkinson's 
disease (PD) as several studies have shown that they are associated with 
increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and mortality. Information about factors 
related to swallowing disturbances, such as disease duration, age at assessment 
and concomitant dementia, is limited and would be useful for their management.
METHODS: All consecutive PD out-patients evaluated at a movement disorders 
clinic over a 7-year period (2007-2014), were included in the present 
retrospective study. Presence of symptomatic swallowing disturbances was 
assessed using the specific item of the Non Motor Symptom Questionnaire.
RESULTS: In the whole PD population (N = 6462), prevalence of symptomatic 
swallowing disturbances was 11.7% (95%CI, 10.9-12.5). Multivariable logistic 
regression analysis (adjusted for education) disclosed a significant interaction 
between disease duration and gender (P = 0.009). In both gender strata, 
swallowing disturbances were significantly associated with longer disease 
duration and dementia (P < 0.001 for all). A significant effect for age at 
assessment was also found in male patients. In non-demented patients, swallowing 
disturbances were associated with male gender, age and disease duration 
(P < 0.02 for all). In demented patients an association was found only with male 
gender (P = 0.018) and disease duration (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, disease duration and dementia all seem to contribute 
to the occurrence of swallowing disturbances independently. However, the role 
played by these factors in sub-groups of patients stratified by gender and 
concomitant dementia suggests that swallowing disturbances are likely related to 
different neuro-degenerative patterns within the brain. The underlying 
mechanisms deserve further investigation.

BACKGROUND: REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is typically linked to 
synucleinopathies (SP). In this study we analyzed the utility and performance of 
RBD as a tool for the differential diagnosis of the most common forms of 
degenerative parkinsonism, including SPs and tauopathies.
METHODS: Patients with a syndromic diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonism 
matched for gender, age, and disease stage were assessed using a structured 
protocol with demographic and clinical data, including the diagnosis of probable 
RBD (pRBD), ascertained clinically using established criteria.
RESULTS: One hundred cases of Parkinson's disease (PD), 87 with progressive 
supranuclear palsy (PSP), 72 with the parkinsonian form of multiple system 
atrophy (MSA), 50 with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 18 with corticobasal 
degeneration (CBD) were included. pRBD was found in 58 (58%) of the PD patients, 
59 (81.9%) of those with MSA, 37 (74%) with DLB, 32 (36.7%) with PSP, and one 
(5.5%) with CBD. Among the SPs, pRBD was significantly more common in MSA when 
compared with PD patients. Differences were also significant individually for 
all SPs when compared to PSP. The positive predictive value (PPV) of pRBD for a 
SP was 82.3%, but sensitivity was 69.4% and specificity 68.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, pRBD was more frequent in SPs than in PSP and CBD, 
however, its' frequency in PSP was significant. Although pRBD had a good PPV for 
a SP, all other measurements used for determine diagnostic performance were 
disappointing.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence linking low dose pesticide exposure and 
chronic ill-health in UK sheep farmers is limited. Our aim was to examine 
whether neuropsychiatric disorders were associated with low dose chronic and/or 
more acute pesticide exposure in sheep farmers.
METHODS: A cohort of British farmers working in the 1970s was sent a screening 
questionnaire which asked about their health and work history. The prevalence of 
screen-positive depression, dementia, Parkinsonism and neuropathy was determined 
using a priori algorithms. Self-reported pesticide exposure was assessed by 
whether the participant had ever handled the pesticide concentrate (for low dose 
chronic exposure) or sought advice for pesticide poisoning (acute exposure) and 
participants categorised into those with only acute or chronic exposure, those 
with both acute and chronic exposure and those with neither acute nor chronic 
exposure. Associations between acute and chronic pesticide exposure, and 
screen-positive ill-health were determined after adjustment for demographic, 
lifestyle, occupation and somatic severity scores and other variables.
RESULTS: In those participants, who had never sought advice for pesticide 
poisoning, handling the pesticide concentrate for treating sheep was associated 
with elevated ORs for screen-positive neuropathy (ORadi 1.57 95%CI 0.97-2.54) 
and Parkinsonism (ORadj 1.56 95%CI 0.95-2.56) but not depression or dementia. In 
those participants who had handled the pesticide concentrate, seeking advice for 
pesticide poisoning was associated with screen-positive depression (Odds ratio, 
ORadj=9.97 95%CI 4.76-20.8 ), dementia (OR=6.94 95%CI 3.44-14.0), Parkinsonism 
(ORadj=4.77 95% 2.39-9.52), and neuropathy (ORadj=4.77 95%CI 2.39-9.52). 
Adjustment for somatic severity score modified little the associations with 
pesticide handling in those not acutely exposed but reduced the ORs for seeking 
advice for pesticide poisoning in those exposed chronically. Furthermore, 
stratification of results based upon somatic severity score indicated that the 
highest ORs for handling the pesticide concentrate associated with neuropathy 
and Parkinsonism were found in those participants whose somatic score was 
minimal.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with low-dose exposure to pesticides being 
associated with screen-positive neuropathy and Parkinsonism but the stronger 
associations between seeking advice for pesticide poisoning and screen-positive 
ill-health suggest that acute pesticide exposure remains an important 
determinant of ill-health. Further work is required to better delineate to what 
extent low dose exposures may contribute to ill-health in populations without 
acute exposures. Somatising tendency does not appear to play an important role 
in this population.

OBJECT: To estimate the prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) in Finland.
METHODS: Persons diagnosed with HD from 1987 to 2010 were identified in the 
national registers and hospital records of the identified patients, and death 
certificates of the deceased subjects were obtained. Results of genetic analyses 
were obtained from the two national laboratories.
RESULTS: Following the discovery of the Huntingtin gene (HTT), the rate of new 
diagnoses of HD has increased in Finland. We ascertained 207 patients with HD, 
114 of whom were alive on 31 December, 2010 suggesting a minimum estimate of 
point prevalence of 2.12/100,000. The age at the time of diagnosis was 
52.6 ± 12.1 years (mean ± standard deviation) and the duration of the disease 
was 8.5 ± 4.4 years among deceased patients. The length of the CAG repeats in 
the affected allele was 43.3 ± 3.5 repeats and the length was inversely 
correlated with the age at diagnosis (β = -0.73, p < 0.001). The number of 
diagnoses varied regionally, whereas the repeat length did not. The frequency of 
the high risk HTT haplogroup A was 39% in Finnish chromosomes abstracted from 
the 1000 Genomes database compared to 53% in other European samples (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: The annual rate of HD diagnoses and the age at diagnosis have 
increased. The prevalence of HD in the Finnish population is lower than that of 
other Caucasian populations, partly explained by the low frequency of HTT 
haplogroup A among the Finns.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is an 
association between cataracts and Parkinson's disease in Taiwan.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the database of 
the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program from 1999 to 2002. This study 
consisted of 26,031 individuals aged 40-84 years with newly diagnosed cataracts 
as the cataract group and 25,937 randomly selected individuals without cataracts 
as the non-cataract group. Both groups were matched for sex, age and index year 
of diagnosing cataracts. The incidence of Parkinson's disease by the end of 2011 
and the association of Parkinson's disease with cataracts and other 
comorbidities were measured.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of Parkinson's disease was 1.48-fold higher in 
the cataract group than the non-cataract group (3.18 vs. 2.15 per 1000 
person-years, crude HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.32, 1.66). After adjusting for confounding 
factors, the adjusted HR of Parkinson's disease was 1.26 (95% CI 1.12, 1.42) for 
the cataract group, when compared with the non-cataract group. Dementia (HR 
2.72, 95% CI 1.92, 3.84), depression (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.63, 2.66), hypertension 
(HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.26, 1.61), cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 
1.63) and age (every one year, HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07, 1.09) were other factors 
significantly related to Parkinson's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study discloses a 26% increased hazard of Parkinson's 
disease in cataract patients. Further studies are required to investigate 
whether cataracts are one of non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease.

Mutations in the GBA gene are related to an increased risk of developing 
neurodegenerative diseases. The exact molecular mechanisms involved in the 
interaction between GBA and α-synuclein, a protein that has been associated with 
several neurological diseases, remain unsolved. Brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is important for the normal development of 
the peripheral and central nervous system, and it plays a key role in neuronal 
survival and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. A reduction in BDNF 
expression has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. We analyzed BDNF levels in the plasma of 
Gaucher Disease (GD) patients who were not being treated with enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) and then subsequently following ERT; we compared the levels to 
those of healthy controls. We demonstrated that BDNF levels were remarkably 
diminished in GD patients who were under no specific treatment and these levels 
increased following ERT. This is the first study that demonstrates a variation 
in the plasma levels of a neurotrophic factor in GD type 1 patients. Further 
studies are required to correlate BDNF level variations with the clinical 
findings and the response to therapy in GD patients. Low levels of BDNF are 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, BDNF could provide a new 
therapeutic target for GD patients with neurological symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Slowing of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is frequent in Parkinson's 
(PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. As 
overlap pathology plays a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, it is likely 
that demented patients in PD show similar physiological alterations as in AD.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze distinctive quantitative EEG characteristics in early 
cognitive dysfunction in PD and AD.
METHODS: Forty patients (20 PD- and 20 AD patients with early cognitive 
impairment) and 20 normal controls (NC) were matched for gender, age, and 
education. Resting state EEG was recorded from 256 electrodes. Relative power 
spectra, median frequency (4-14 Hz), and neuropsychological outcome were 
compared between groups.
RESULTS: Relative theta power in left temporal region and median frequency 
separated the three groups significantly (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001). Relative 
theta power was increased and median frequency reduced in patients with both 
diseases compared to NC. Median frequency was higher in AD than in PD and 
classified groups significantly (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Increase of theta power in the left temporal region and a reduction 
of median frequency were associated with presence of AD or PD. PD patients are 
characterized by a pronounced slowing as compared to AD patients. Therefore, in 
both disorders EEG slowing might be a useful biomarker for beginning cognitive 
decline.

INTRODUCTION: Compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) is usually associated with a more complex clinical picture and higher 
burden of care. Yet, few investigations have been performed on comorbidities and 
risk factors of DLB. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical risk factors and 
comorbidity profile in DLB and AD patients using two nationwide registries.
METHODS: This is a linkage study between the Swedish dementia registry (SveDem) 
and the Swedish National Patient Registry conducted on 634 subjects with DLB and 
9161 individuals with AD registered during the years 2007-2012. Comorbidity 
profile has been coded according to the International Classification of Diseases 
version 10 (ICD 10) in addition to the date of each event. The main chapters of 
the ICD-10, the Charlson score of comorbidities and a selected number of 
neuropsychiatric diseases were compared between the DLB and AD groups. 
Comorbidity was registered before and after the dementia diagnosis.
RESULTS: "Mental and behavioral disorders", "diseases of the nervous system", 
"diseases of the eye and adnexa", diseases of the "circulatory", "respiratory", 
and "genitourinary" systems, "diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue" and 
"diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue" occurred more 
frequently in the DLB group after multivariate adjustment. Depression [adjusted 
OR = 2.12 (95%CI 1.49 to 3.03)] and migraine [adjusted OR = 3.65 (95%CI 1.48 to 
9.0)] were more commonly recorded before the diagnosis of dementia in the DLB 
group. Following dementia diagnosis, ischemic stroke [adjusted OR = 1.89 (95%CI 
1.21 to 2.96)] was more likely to happen among the DLB patients compared to the 
AD population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated a worse comorbidity profile in DLB patients 
with higher occurrence of depression, stroke and migraine compared with the AD 
group. Deeper knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of these associations is 
needed to explore possible reasons for the different pattern of comorbidity 
profile in DLB compared to AD and their prognostic significance.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has become the second most common 
neurodegenerative dementia due to demographic ageing. Differential diagnosis is 
still troublesome especially in early stages of the disease, since there is a 
great clinical and neuropathological overlap primarily with Alzheimer's disease 
and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, more specific biomarkers, not only for 
scientific reasons but also for clinical therapeutic decision-making, are 
urgently needed. In this review, we summarize the knowledge on fluid biomarkers 
for DLB, derived predominantly from cerebrospinal fluid. We discuss the value of 
well-defined markers (β-amyloid, (phosphorylated) tau, α-synuclein) as well as 
some promising 'upcoming' substances, which still have to be further evaluated.

GluN2B subunit containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) mediate pathophysiological 
effects of acutely applied amyloid beta (Aβ), including impaired long-term 
potentiation (LTP). However, in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models 
which feature gradual Aβ accumulation, the function of GluN2B-NMDARs and their 
contribution to synaptic plasticity are unknown. Therefore, we examined the role 
of GluN2B-NMDARs in synaptic function and plasticity in the hippocampus of 
PS2APP transgenic mice. Although LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) 
was normal in PS2APP mice, it was significantly reduced by the selective 
GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981 (Ro25) in PS2APP mice, but not wild type (wt) 
mice. While NMDARs activated by single synaptic stimuli were not blocked by 
Ro25, NMDARs recruited during burst stimulation showed larger blockade by Ro25 
in PS2APP mice. Thus, the unusual dependence of LTP on GluN2B-NMDARs in PS2APP 
mice suggests that non-synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs are activated by glutamate that 
spills out of synaptic cleft during the burst stimulation used to induce LTP. 
While long-term depression (LTD) was normal in PS2APP mice, and Ro25 had no 
impact on LTD in wt mice, Ro25 impaired LTD in PS2APP mice, again demonstrating 
aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR function during plasticity. Together these results 
demonstrate altered GluN2B-NMDAR function in a model of early AD pathology that 
has implications for the therapeutic targeting of NMDARs in AD.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of degenerative 
dementia following Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB is clinically and 
pathologically related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD dementia, and the 
three disorders can be viewed as existing on a spectrum of Lewy body disease. In 
recent years there has been a concerted effort to establish the phenotypes of AD 
and PD in the prodromal phase (before the respective syndromes of cognitive and 
motor impairment are expressed). Evidence for the prodromal presentation of DLB 
is also emerging. This paper briefly reviews what is known about the clinical 
presentation of prodromal DLB before discussing the pathology of Lewy body 
disease and how this relates to potential biomarkers of prodromal DLB. The 
presenting features of DLB can be broadly placed in three categories: cognitive 
impairment (particularly nonamnestic cognitive impairments), 
behavioural/psychiatric phenomena (for example, hallucinations, rapid eye 
movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)) and physical symptoms (for example, 
parkinsonism, decreased sense of smell, autonomic dysfunction). Some 
noncognitive symptoms such as constipation, RBD, hyposmia and postural dizziness 
can predate the onset of memory impairment by several years in DLB. Pathological 
studies of Lewy body disease have found that the earliest sites of involvement 
are the olfactory bulb, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, the 
peripheral autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system, and 
the brainstem. Some of the most promising early markers for DLB include the 
presence of RBD, autonomic dysfunction or hyposmia, 
(123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy, measures of substantia 
nigra pathology and skin biopsy for α-synuclein in peripheral autonomic nerves. 
In the absence of disease-modifying therapies, the diagnosis of prodromal DLB is 
of limited use in the clinic. That said, knowledge of the prodromal development 
of DLB could help clinicians identify cases of DLB where the diagnosis is 
uncertain. Prodromal diagnosis is of great importance in research, where 
identifying Lewy body disease at an earlier stage may allow researchers to 
investigate the initial phases of dementia pathophysiology, develop treatments 
designed to interrupt the development of the dementia syndrome and accurately 
identify the patients most likely to benefit from these treatments.

BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of depression is common in primary care practices, but 
data are lacking on the prevalence in Canadian practices. We describe the 
prevalence of the diagnosis among men and women, patient characteristics and 
drug treatment in patients diagnosed with depression in the primary care setting 
in Canada.
METHODS: Using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care 
Sentinel Surveillance Network, we examined whether the prevalence of a 
depression diagnosis varied by patient characteristics, the number of chronic 
conditions and the presence of the following chronic conditions: hypertension, 
diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis, dementia, 
epilepsy and parkinsonism. We used regression models to examine whether patient 
characteristics and type of comorbidity were associated with a depression 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 304 412 patients who had at least 1 encounter with their primary 
care provider between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2012, 14% had a diagnosis of 
depression. Current or past smokers and women with a high body mass index had 
higher rates of depression. One in 4 patients with a diagnosis of depression 
also had another chronic condition; those with depression had 1.5 times more 
primary care visits. About 85% of patients with depression were prescribed 
medication, most frequently selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, followed by 
atypical antipsychotics.
INTERPRETATION: Our data provide information on the prevalence of a depression 
diagnosis in primary care and associations with being female, having a chronic 
condition, smoking history and obesity in women. Our findings may inform 
research and assist primary care providers with early detection and 
interventions in at-risk patient populations.

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) may be the onset of several neurodegenerative 
diseases. This study evaluates a cohort of patients with PPA to assess their 
progression to different clinical syndromes, associated factors that modulate 
this progression, and patterns of cerebral metabolism linked to different 
clinical evolutionary forms. Thirty-five patients meeting PPA criteria underwent 
a clinical and neuroimaging (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET evaluation. Survival 
analysis was performed using time from clinical onset to the development of a 
non-language symptom or deficit (PPA-plus). Cerebral metabolism was analyzed 
using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Patients classified into three PPA 
variants evolved to atypical parkinsonism, behavioral disorder and motor neuron 
disease in the agrammatic variant; to behavioral disorder in the semantic; and 
to memory impairment in the logopenic. Median time from the onset of symptoms to 
PPA-plus was 36 months (31-40, 95 % confidence interval). Right laterality, and 
years of education were associated to a lower risk of progression, while 
logopenic variant to a higher risk. Different regions of hypometabolism were 
identified in agrammatic PPA with parkinsonism, motor neuron disease and 
logopenic PPA-plus. Clinical course of PPA differs according to each variant. 
Left anterior temporal and frontal medial hypometabolism in agrammatic variant 
is linked to motor neuron disease and atypical parkinsonism, respectively. PPA 
variant, laterality and education may be associated to the risk of progression. 
These results suggest the possibility that clinical and imaging data could help 
to predict the clinical course of PPA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe Parkinson's 
disease (PD) outperforms the best medical treatment in controlling motor 
symptoms and improving quality of life. Nevertheless disease progression cannot 
be controlled, and the development of dementia over time is nearly inevitable, 
often resulting in nursing home placement. Ten-year survival, development of 
hallucinations, dementia and nursing home placement were examined and adverse 
events were assessed.
METHOD: Patient files were scrutinized from baseline up to 10 years of treatment 
or death on all 79 PD patients treated with DBS of the subthalamic nucleus from 
1998 to 2003 at Aarhus University Hospital.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients died during the follow-up period of 10 years. Age 
above 60 years at surgery increased mortality 2.3-fold (P = 0.04). Of the 55 
surviving patients 29 (53%) were demented and 19 (35%) were in nursing homes. 
Average time from operation to dementia was 5.6 ± 2.9 years. Hallucinations and 
nursing home placement were associated with increased mortality.
CONCLUSION: Survival of 70% after a mean of 25 years of PD including 10 years 
with DBS illustrates that this is a selected group of PD patients. The 
prevalence of dementia steadily increased after surgery as expected from disease 
progression and can be an early event. Compared with the few similar long-term 
studies, the present study presents a larger cohort followed at the same DBS 
center for a longer period of time and none was lost to follow-up, making 
conclusions more valid. The present findings are of significant prognostic help 
for the patient, caregiver and physician when treatment with DBS has to be 
decided.

INTRODUCTION. The cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) have 
traditionally been associated with the presence of dementia in later stages of 
the disease. Recent studies, however, consider that cognitive impairment can 
appear as of early stages. Knowing the cognitive profile of PD furthers our 
understanding of the clinical phenotype, making it easier to reach a timely 
diagnosis and favouring intervention on the symptoms from the initial stages. 
AIM. To present a review of the literature on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and dementia associated with PD. DEVELOPMENT. Several studies report that 
patients with PD who have a prolonged time to progression develop dementia. Yet, 
there have also been reports claiming that, as of the early stages, patients can 
present subtle cognitive alterations known as MCI. The initial 
neuropsychological profile is mainly of a non-amnesic type, characterised by 
executive dysfunction, alterations affecting attention, operative memory deficit 
and faulty retrieval of information. When patients develop dementia, disorders 
will arise in the storage of information, in semantic fluency, and in 
visuospatial and visuoperceptual skills. Currently there are criteria available 
for diagnosing the MCI and dementia associated with PD, as well as valid 
reliable instruments for detecting those disorders. CONCLUSIONS. Cognitive 
symptoms are frequent in PD. From the initial stages of the disease onwards 
patients may present MCI that is mainly characterised by a fronto-subcortical 
cognitive profile, whereas dementia usually develops at later stages, when a 
pattern of posterior cortical cognitive disorder is also observed.

Publisher: TITLE: Demencia y deterioro cognitivo leve en la enfermedad de 
Parkinson: una revision.
Introduccion. Clasicamente, las alteraciones cognitivas en la enfermedad de 
Parkinson (EP) se han asociado a la presencia de demencia en etapas tardias de 
la enfermedad; sin embargo, estudios recientes consideran que el deterioro 
cognitivo puede aparecer desde etapas tempranas. Conocer el perfil cognitivo de 
la EP contribuye a la comprension del fenotipo clinico, facilita el diagnostico 
oportuno y favorece la intervencion de los sintomas desde estadios iniciales. 
Objetivo. Presentar una revision de la bibliografia del deterioro cognitivo leve 
(DCL) y demencia asociados a la EP. Desarrollo. Diversos estudios indican que 
los pacientes con EP que tienen un tiempo de evolucion prolongado de la 
enfermedad desarrollan demencia. Sin embargo, tambien se ha descrito que, desde 
etapas tempranas, los pacientes pueden presentar sutiles alteraciones cognitivas 
conocidas como DCL; el perfil neuropsicologico inicial es principalmente de tipo 
no amnesico, caracterizado por disfuncion ejecutiva, alteraciones atencionales, 
deficit de la memoria operativa y fallas en la recuperacion de la informacion. 
Cuando los pacientes desarrollan demencia, surgen alteraciones en el 
almacenamiento de la informacion, en la fluidez semantica y en las habilidades 
visuoespaciales y visuoperceptuales. En la actualidad, existen criterios 
disponibles para el diagnostico de DCL y demencia asociados a la EP, e 
instrumentos validos y fiables para la deteccion de dichas alteraciones. 
Conclusiones. Los sintomas cognitivos son frecuentes en la EP; desde las etapas 
iniciales de la enfermedad, los pacientes pueden presentar DCL caracterizado 
principalmente por un perfil cognitivo frontosubcortical, mientras que la 
demencia suele desarrollarse en etapas tardias, cuando se añade un patron de 
alteracion cognitiva cortical posterior.

Telomere length (TL) is regarded as a marker of cellular aging due to the 
gradual shortening by each cell division, but is influenced by a number of 
factors including oxidative stress and inflammation. Parkinson's disease and 
atypical forms of parkinsonism occur mainly in the elderly, with oxidative 
stress and inflammation in afflicted cells. In this study the relationship 
between blood TL and prognosis of 168 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism (136 
Parkinson's disease [PD], 17 Progressive Supranuclear Palsy [PSP], and 15 
Multiple System Atrophy [MSA]) and 30 controls was investigated. TL and motor 
and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline (diagnosis) and repeatedly 
up to three to five years follow up. No difference in TL between controls and 
patients was shown at baseline, nor any significant difference in TL stability 
or attrition during follow up. Interestingly, a significant relationship between 
TL at diagnosis and cognitive phenotype at follow up in PD and PSP patients was 
found, with longer mean TL at diagnosis in patients that developed dementia 
within three years.

Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most common 
neurodegenerative disorders. For both diseases, early intervention is thought to 
be essential to the success of disease-modifying treatments. Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) can reflect some of the pathophysiological changes that occur in the 
brain, and the number of CSF biomarkers under investigation in neurodegenerative 
conditions has grown rapidly in the past 20 years. In AD, CSF biomarkers are 
increasingly being used in clinical practice, and have been incorporated into 
the majority of clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, to enrich or 
stratify patient groups, and to find evidence of disease modification. In PD, 
CSF biomarkers have not yet reached the clinic, but are being studied in 
patients with parkinsonism, and are being used in clinical trials either to 
monitor progression or to demonstrate target engagement and downstream effects 
of drugs. CSF biomarkers might also serve as surrogate markers of clinical 
benefit after a specific therapeutic intervention, although additional data are 
required. It is anticipated that CSF biomarkers will have an important role in 
trials aimed at disease modification in the near future. In this Review, we 
provide an overview of CSF biomarkers in AD and PD, and discuss their role in 
clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: To examine whether imitation of gestures provided useful 
information to diagnose early dementia in elderly patients.
METHODS: Imitation of finger and hand gestures was evaluated in patients with 
mild dementia; 74 patients had dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 100 with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 52 with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD).
RESULTS: Significantly, more patients with DLB (32.4%) compared with patients 
with AD (5%) or SVaD (11.5%) had an impaired ability to imitate finger gestures 
bilaterally. Also, significantly, more patients with DLB (36.5%) compared with 
patients with AD (5%) or SVaD (15.4%) had lower mean scores of both hands. In 
contrast, impairment of the imitation of bimanual gestures was comparable among 
the three patient groups (DLB 50%, AD 42%, SVaD 42.3%).
DISCUSSION: Our study revealed that imitation of bimanual gestures was impaired 
non-specifically in about half of the patients with mild dementia, whereas 
imitation of finger gestures was significantly more impaired in patients with 
early DLB than in those with AD or SVaD. Although the sensitivity was not high, 
the imitation tasks may provide additional information for diagnosis of mild 
dementia, especially for DLB.

Clinically, predicting the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
diagnosing dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult. This study aims 
to explore an integrative electroencephalography (EEG) frequency power that 
could be used to predict the progression of MCI in PD patients. Twenty-six PD 
patients, in this study, were divided into the mild cognitive impairment group 
(PDMCI, 17 patients) and dementia group (PDD, 9 patients) according to cognitive 
performance. Beta peak frequency, alpha relative power, and alpha/theta power 
were recorded and analyzed for the prediction. Mini Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) scores at initiation, in the first year, and in the second year were 
examined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, Matthew 
correlation coefficient, and positive likelihood ratio were calculated in both 
the integrative EEG biomarkers and single best biomarker. Of the 17 patients 
with MCI for 2 years, 6 progressed to dementia. Integrative EEG biomarkers, 
mainly associated with beta peak frequency, can predict conversion from MCI to 
dementia. These biomarkers had sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 78%, 
compared with sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 58% of the beta peak 
frequency. In conclusion, the integrative EEG frequency powers were more 
sensitive and specific to MCI progression in PD patients.

The extent to which deficits in specific cognitive domains contribute to older 
drivers' safety risk in complex real-world driving tasks is not well understood. 
We selected 148 drivers older than 70 years of age both with and without 
neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer disease-AD and Parkinson disease-PD) from 
an existing driving database of older adults. Participant assessments included 
on-road driving safety and cognitive functioning in visuospatial construction, 
speed of processing, memory, and executive functioning. The standardized on-road 
drive test was designed to examine multiple facets of older driver safety 
including navigation performance (e.g., following a route, identifying 
landmarks), safety errors while concurrently performing secondary navigation 
tasks ("on-task" safety errors), and safety errors in the absence of any 
secondary navigation tasks ("baseline" safety errors). The inter-correlations of 
these outcome measures were fair to moderate supporting their distinctiveness. 
Participants with diseases performed worse than the healthy aging group on all 
driving measures and differences between those with AD and PD were minimal. In 
multivariate analyses, different domains of cognitive functioning predicted 
distinct facets of driver safety on road. Memory and set-shifting predicted 
performance in navigation-related secondary tasks, speed of processing predicted 
on-task safety errors, and visuospatial construction predicted baseline safety 
errors. These findings support broad assessments of cognitive functioning to 
inform decisions regarding older driver safety on the road and suggest 
navigation performance may be useful in evaluating older driver fitness and 
restrictions in licensing.

Molecular imaging biomarkers for dementia with Lewy bodies: an update.

Mukaetova-Ladinska EB(1).

Author information:
(1)Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK.

BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is considered to be the second most 
common form of neurodegenerative disorders after Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
affecting as many as 100,000 people in the UK and up to 1.3 million in the USA. 
However, nearly half of patients with DLB remain undiagnosed thus depriving many 
of them from an early and adequate treatment of their distressing symptoms. 
Accurate and early diagnosis of DLB is important for both patients and their 
caregivers, since the neuropsychiatric symptoms require specific management.
METHODS: In the current study, we review the most recent developments in the 
field of molecular nuclear imaging to diagnose DLB.
RESULTS: The review addresses, the neurotransmitter based (dopaminergic, 
cholinergic, and glutamatergic) nuclear imaging techniques, role of the 
autonomic dysfunction and its visualization in DLB with myocardial sympathetic 
imaging and vesicular catecholamine uptake, as well as the use of amyloid 
polypeptides and glial markers as molecular imaging probes in the clinical 
diagnosis of DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the above nuclear imaging methods are restricted to highly 
specialized clinical centers, and thus not applicable to a large number of 
patients requiring dementia (e.g. DLB) diagnosis in routine clinical setting. 
Validating them against more readily accessible peripheral biomarkers, e.g. CSF 
and blood biomarkers linked to the DLB process, may facilitate their use in 
wider clinical settings.

INTRODUCTION: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of 
executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to 
detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this 
study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control 
group (CG) using a traditional assessment of EFs and the Virtual Multiple 
Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality (VR)-based tool. In order to understand 
which subcomponents of EFs are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to 
investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three 
groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each 
(for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD-NC; 15 PD-MCI, and 15 cognitively 
healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning 
and the EFs, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the 
participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological 
evaluation of EFs.
RESULTS: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between 
the PD-NC patients vs. the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in 
the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies 
to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early 
detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the 
traditional assessment of EFs (neuropsychological battery).
CONCLUSION: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid 
evaluation of EFs is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive 
deficits.

BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may display a 
different cognitive pattern from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with more severe 
impairment performing visuospatial/visuoconstructive tasks. The aim of this 
study was to investigate whether the analysis of the MMSE pentagon copy could be 
a useful diagnostic screening tool in prodromal DLB.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) were followed 
over 3-years until a diagnosis of DLB (MCI-DLB: n = 30) and AD (MCI-AD: n = 23) 
were made according to standard criteria. At the first assessment patients 
underwent a thorough cognitive assessment including the Qualitative Scoring MMSE 
Pentagon Test (QSPT), the NPI, the UPDRS as well as questionnaires to determine 
fluctuations and sleep disorders.
RESULTS: The percentage of subjects who were unable to determine the correct 
number of angles in the pentagon copy test was 45.1% of MCI-DLB and 8.3% of 
MCI-AD patients (sensitivity 41.1%; specificity 91%). Attentive/executive 
functions and visual-spatial abilities were worse in the MCI-DLB group, while 
episodic memory impairment was greater in MCI-AD. Subtle extrapyramidal signs 
(63%) and RBD symptoms (56%) were the most frequent clinical features supporting 
the diagnosis of MCI-DLB.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a poor performance in determining the number of 
angles when performing the pentagon copying test, together with the presence of 
subtle extrapyramidal signs and symptoms of RBD may serve as a predictive tool 
for early DLB.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by motor deficits as well as cognitive 
alterations, particularly concerning frontal lobe control. Here, we were 
interested in whether executive function is abnormal already early in PD, as 
well as whether this dysfunction worsens as a part of the dementia in PD. The 
following groups engaged in tasks addressing action control: PD patients with 
mild and advanced motor symptoms (aPD) without dementia, PD patients with 
dementia (PDD), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy subjects 
(CON). Subjects either had to perform or inhibit button presses upon go and 
no-go cues, respectively. These cues were preceded by pre-cues, either randomly 
instructive of right or left hand preparation (switch condition), or 
repetitively instructive for one side only (non-switch condition). PDD and aPD 
omitted more go responses than CON. Furthermore, PDD disproportionally committed 
failures upon no-go cues compared to CON. In the non-switch condition, PDD 
performed worse than AD, whose deficits increased to the level of PDD in the 
switch condition. Over all PD patients, task performance correlated with disease 
severity. Under the switch condition, task performance was low in both PDD and 
AD. In the non-switch condition, this also held true for advanced PD patients 
(with and without dementia), but not for AD. Thus, the deficits evident in PDD 
appear to develop from imbalanced inhibitory-to-excitatory action control 
generally inherent to PD. These results specify the concept of dysexecution in 
PD and differentiate the cognitive profile of PDD from that of AD patients.

Exploring myelin dysfunction in multiple system atrophy.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, yet fatal neurodegenerative disease 
that presents clinically with autonomic failure in combination with parkinsonism 
or cerebellar ataxia. MSA impacts on the autonomic nervous system affecting 
blood pressure, heart rate and bladder function, and the motor system affecting 
balance and muscle movement. The cause of MSA is unknown, no definitive risk 
factors have been identified, and there is no cure or effective treatment. The 
definitive pathology of MSA is the presence of α-synuclein aggregates in the 
brain and therefore MSA is classified as an α-synucleinopathy, together with 
Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Although the molecular 
mechanisms of misfolding, fibrillation and aggregation of α-synuclein partly 
overlap with other α-synucleinopathies, the pathological pathway of MSA is 
unique in that the principal site for α-synuclein deposition is in the 
oligodendrocytes rather than the neurons. The sequence of pathological events of 
MSA is now recognized as abnormal protein redistributions in oligodendrocytes 
first, followed by myelin dysfunction and then neurodegeneration. 
Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the production and maintenance of myelin, 
the specialized lipid membrane that encases the axons of all neurons in the 
brain. Myelin is composed of lipids and two prominent proteins, myelin basic 
protein and proteolipid protein. In vitro studies suggest that aberration in 
protein distribution and lipid transport may lead to myelin dysfunction in MSA. 
The purpose of this perspective is to bring together available evidence to 
explore the potential role of α-synuclein, myelin protein dysfunction, lipid 
dyshomeostasis and ABCA8 in MSA pathogenesis.

The clinical diagnostic criteria of Parkinson's disease (PD) have limitations in 
detecting the disease at early stage and in differentiating heterogeneous 
clinical progression. The lack of reliable biomarker(s) for early diagnosis and 
prediction of prognosis is a major hurdle to achieve optimal clinical care of 
patients and efficient design of clinical trials for disease-modifying 
therapeutics. Numerous efforts to discover PD biomarkers in CSF were conducted. 
In this review, we describe the molecular pathogenesis of PD and discuss its 
implication to develop PD biomarkers in CSF. Next, we summarize the clinical 
utility of CSF biomarkers including alpha-synuclein for early and differential 
diagnosis, and prediction of PD progression. Given the heterogeneity in the 
clinical features of PD and none of the CSF biomarkers for an early diagnosis 
have been developed, research efforts to develop biomarkers to predict 
heterogeneous disease progression is on-going. Notably, a rapid cognitive 
decline followed by the development of dementia is a risk factor of poor 
prognosis in PD. In connection to this, CSF levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
biomarkers have received considerable attention. However, we still need 
long-term longitudinal observational studies employing large cohorts to evaluate 
the clinical utility of CSF biomarkers reflecting Lewy body pathology and AD 
pathology in the brain. We believe that current research efforts including the 
Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative will resolve the current needs of 
early diagnosis and/or prediction of disease progression using CSF biomarkers, 
and which will further accelerate the development of disease-modifying 
therapeutics and optimize the clinical management of PD patients.

INTRODUCTION: Lysosomal glucosidase beta acid (GBA) deficiency is inherent to 
Gaucher disease, Parkinsonism and Lewy-body dementia. Increased GBA expression 
has never been associated with human disease. We describe increased GBA 
expression and activity in placenta from preeclamptic pregnancies.
METHODS: 112 placenta biopsies were available for qPCR, analysis of GBA gene 
expression and activity. Microanalysis was performed on 20 placenta samples. 
Alternatively spliced placental GBA transcripts were cloned, expressed in HEK293 
cells and analyzed by Western blot and activity assay.
RESULTS: GBA is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of human placenta 
already at 5 weeks of gestation. We identified five novel GBA transcripts in 
placenta that enzymatically inactive when expressed in HEK293 cells. Both GBA 
RNA expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated in preeclamptic placenta. 
Microarray analysis of 20 placenta tissues identified 158 genes co-regulating 
with GBA expression and gene enrichment analysis highlights lysosomal function. 
In our micro-array data GBA expression does not correlate with FLT1 expression, 
currently the most powerful marker for preeclampsia. There are 89 transcripts 
that are negatively correlated with GBA expression of which BMP4 and TFEB are 
interesting as they are essential to early placenta function.
DISCUSSION: Although very speculative, we hypothesize that increased GBA 
expression might relate to placentation through decreased BMP4 signaling or 
vascularization through downregulation of TFEB. Ceramide, the product of 
hydrolysis of glucosylceramide by GBA and involved in the regulation of cell 
differentiation, survival and apoptosis, is another putative candidate linking 
increased GBA activity to preeclampsia. Both pathways merit further 
investigation.

The groundbreaking discovery of mutations in the SNCA gene in a rare familial 
form of Parkinson's disease (PD) has revolutionized our basic understanding of 
the etiology of PD and other related disorders. Genome-wide Association Studies 
has demonstrated a wide array of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 
the increasing risk of developing the more common type, sporadic PD, further 
corroborating the genetic etiology of PD. Among them, SNCA is a gene responsible 
for encoding α-synuclein, a protein found to be the major component of Lewy body 
and Lewy neurite, both of these components are the pathognomonic hallmarks of 
PD. Thus, it has been postulated that this gene plays specific roles in 
pathogenesis of PD. Here, we summarize the basic biological characteristics of 
the wild type of the protein (wt-α-synuclein) as well as genetic and epigenetic 
features of its encoding gene (SNCA) in PD. Based on these characteristics, SNCA 
may be involved in PD pathogenesis in at least 2 ways: wt-α-synuclein 
overexpression and its mutation types via different mechanisms. Associations 
between SNCA mutations and other Lewy body disorders, such as dementia with Lewy 
bodies and multiple system atrophy, are also mentioned. Finally, it is necessary 
to explore the influences which SNCA exerts on clinical and neuropathological 
phenotypes by promoting the transfer of scientific research into practice, such 
as clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. We believe it 
is promising to target SNCA for developing novel therapeutic strategies for 
parkinsonism.

Genetic variation is associated with differences in the function of the brain as 
well as its susceptibility to disease. The common H1 haplotypic variant of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) has been related to an increased 
risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, among PD patients, H1 
homozygotes have an accelerated progression to dementia. We investigated the 
neurocognitive correlates of MAPT haplotypes using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging. Thirty-seven nondemented patients with PD (19 H1/H1, 18 H2 carriers) 
and 40 age-matched controls (21 H1/H1, 19 H2 carriers) were scanned during 
performance of a picture memory encoding task. Behaviorally, H1 homozygosity was 
associated with impaired picture recognition memory in PD patients and control 
subjects. These impairments in the H1 homozygotes were accompanied by an altered 
blood-oxygen level-dependent response in the medial temporal lobe during 
successful memory encoding. Additional age-related differences in blood-oxygen 
level-dependent response were observed in the medial temporal lobes of H1 
homozygotes with PD. These results suggest that common variation in MAPT is not 
only associated with the dementia of PD but also differences in the neural 
circuitry underlying aspects of cognition in normal aging.

INTRODUCTION: Unlike dementia, the effect of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on 
outcomes after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is less 
clear. We aimed to examine the effect of MCI on short- and long-term DBS 
outcomes.
METHODS: To study the effect of MCI type, cognitive domains (attention, 
language, visuospatial, memory, executive function), and Dementia Rating Scale 
(DRS) score on immediate postoperative outcomes (postoperative confusion, 
hospitalization days), PD patients who underwent DBS at our Center from 2006 to 
2011 were analyzed. To determine cognitive predictors of intermediate (6-month) 
and long-term (1-year) post-operative outcomes, the changes in functional and 
quality-of-life (QOL) scores were analyzed in a smaller group with available 
preoperative health status measures.
RESULTS: We identified 130 patients [71% male, mean age: 63 ± 9.1, mean PD 
duration: 10.7 ± 5.1]. At preoperative assessment, 60% of patients had 
multiple-domain MCI, 21% had single-domain MCI, and 19% had normal cognition. 
MCI presence and type as well as DRS performance did not affect immediate 
outcomes. Attention impairment predicted longer postoperative hospitalization (P 
= 0.0015) and showed a trend towards occurrence of postoperative confusion (P = 
0.089). For intermediate and long-term outcomes we identified 56 patients [73.2% 
male, mean age: 61.3 ± 9.6, mean PD duration: 10.6 ± 4.7]. Visuospatial 
impairment showed a trend towards less improvement in 6-month functional score 
(P = 0.0652), and 1-year QOL score (P = 0.0517).
CONCLUSION: The presence of MCI did not affect DBS outcomes. However, the types 
of impaired domains were more detrimental. Detailed cognitive testing can help 
stratify low- and high-risk patients based on their pattern of cognitive 
dysfunction.

The long-term consequences of repetitive head impacts have been described since 
the early 20th century. Terms such as punch drunk and dementia pugilistica were 
first used to describe the clinical syndromes experienced by boxers. A more 
generic designation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), has been employed 
since the mid-1900s and has been used in recent years to describe a 
neurodegenerative disease found not just in boxers but in American football 
players, other contact sport athletes, military veterans, and others with 
histories of repetitive brain trauma, including concussions and subconcussive 
trauma. This article reviews the literature of the clinical manifestations of 
CTE from 202 published cases. The clinical features include impairments in mood 
(for example, depression and hopelessness), behavior (for example, explosivity 
and violence), cognition (for example, impaired memory, executive functioning, 
attention, and dementia), and, less commonly, motor functioning (for example, 
parkinsonism, ataxia, and dysarthria). We present proposed research criteria for 
traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) which consist of four variants or 
subtypes (TES behavioral/mood variant, TES cognitive variant, TES mixed variant, 
and TES dementia) as well as classifications of 'probable CTE' and 'possible 
CTE'. These proposed criteria are expected to be modified and updated as new 
research findings become available. They are not meant to be used for a clinical 
diagnosis. Rather, they should be viewed as research criteria that can be 
employed in studies of the underlying causes, risk factors, differential 
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CTE and related disorders.

Down syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual 
disability and is characterized by a number of behavioral as well as cognitive 
symptoms. Triplication of all or part of human chromosome 21 has been considered 
as the main cause of Down syndrome. Due to the location of the amyloid precursor 
protein on chromosome 21, many of the neuropathological features of early-onset 
Alzheimer's disease including senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are 
also present in Down syndrome patients who are either demented or nondemented. 
Significant advances in medical treatment have increased longevity in people 
with Down syndrome resulting in an increased population that may be subjected to 
many of the same risk factors as those with Alzheimer's disease. It is well 
established that harboring one or both apolipoprotein E4 alleles greatly 
increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, whether apolipoprotein E4 
contributes to an earlier onset of dementia or increased mortality in Down 
syndrome patients is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this mini review 
is to provide an updated assessment on apolipoprotein E4 status and risk 
potential of developing dementia and mortality associated with Down syndrome.

With the rate of aging rising each year, the number of patients with dementia 
increases. The latest study released by the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare estimated that, as of 2012, there were a total of 3.05 million people 
with dementia in Japan, with 10% of aged 65 and over, 15% of aged 70 and over, 
20% of aged 75 and over, and 40% of aged 85 and over. Dementia includes 
Alzheimer's disease, which makes up the most cases, dementia with Lewy bodies, 
frontotemporal dementia, and cerebrovascular dementia which is caused by a 
cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage. Hypothyroidism, normal pressure 
hydrocephalus, and depression also impair cognitive functions, and therefore 
these pathological conditions are easily mistaken for dementia. Methods that can 
easily distinguish between these diseases have been devised. Early and accurate 
diagnoses are very important for patients and their families as there are a 
number of diseases that can be treated. In addition, although Japan only has 
medicines that delay the advance of Alzheimer's disease, in recent years, 
efforts have been made to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease through 
reducing the potential for diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and 
depression, quitting smoking, and improving physical and intellectual 
activities. At the annual meeting last year, we reported the results of a survey 
at our health counseling center on the quality of life a person wants as 
dementia progresses. The survey had some surprising results: two-thirds of the 
people surveyed preferred to be in a group home or an advanced medical center, 
rather than in their own homes. One-third of the respondents expressed a desire 
to be at home. The survey showed that if possible, a person diagnosed with 
dementia will stay at home, however, where this is not possible, they have no 
choice other than to resign themselves to leaving home. Furthermore, patients 
with dementia feel that the medication that will allow them to continue their 
lifestyle at home for long periods is limited. Home care for dementia is said to 
be more difficult than palliative care at home for patients with terminal 
cancer. This paper reports on one case in which medication was not and could not 
be used because the symptoms were too severe. However, home care could be 
continued by preventing the patient 's wife from feeling isolated and being able 
to cope with the prolonged crisis through the environmental improvement.

[(18)F]FDG-PET imaging has been recognized as a crucial diagnostic marker in 
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), supporting the presence or the exclusion of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. A clinical heterogeneity, however, underlies 
MCI definition. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive role of 
single-subject voxel-based maps of [(18)F]FDG distribution generated through 
statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in the progression to different dementia 
subtypes in a sample of 45 MCI. Their scans were compared to a large normal 
reference dataset developed and validated for comparison at single-subject 
level. Additionally, Aβ42 and Tau CSF values were available in 34 MCI subjects. 
Clinical follow-up (mean 28.5 ± 7.8 months) assessed subsequent progression to 
AD or non-AD dementias. The SPM analysis showed: 1) normal brain metabolism in 
14 MCI cases, none of them progressing to dementia; 2) the typical 
temporo-parietal pattern suggestive for prodromal AD in 15 cases, 11 of them 
progressing to AD; 3) brain hypometabolism suggestive of frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD) subtypes in 7 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in 2 
subjects (all fulfilled FTLD or DLB clinical criteria at follow-up); and 4) 7 
MCI cases showed a selective unilateral or bilateral temporo-medial 
hypometabolism without the typical AD pattern, and they all remained stable. In 
our sample, objective voxel-based analysis of [(18)F]FDG-PET scans showed high 
predictive prognostic value, by identifying either normal brain metabolism or 
hypometabolic patterns suggestive of different underlying pathologies, as 
confirmed by progression at follow-up. These data support the potential 
usefulness of this SPM [(18)F]FDG PET analysis in the early dementia diagnosis 
and for improving subject selection in clinical trials based on MCI definition.

OBJECTIVES: Neuro-inflammation is common in α-Synucleinopathies and Tauopathies; 
and evidence suggests a link between the tyrosine kinase Abl and 
neurodegeneration. Abl upregulates α-Synuclein and promotes Tau 
hyper-phosphorylation (p-Tau), while Abl inhibitors facilitate autophagic 
clearance.
METHODS: A model of α-Synucleinopathy harboring human mutant A53T α-Synuclein 
and exhibits concomitant increase in murine p-Tau was used to determine the 
immunological response to Abl inhibition.
RESULTS: Age-dependent alterations of brain immunity, including loss of IL-10 
and decreased levels of IL-2 and IL-3 were observed in old A53T mice. Brain CCL2 
and CCL5 were decreased, but CX3CL1 remained constantly elevated. Young A53T 
mice exhibited differential systemic and central immune profiles in parallel 
with increased blood markers of adaptive immunity, suggesting an early systemic 
immune response. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including nilotinib and 
bosutinib reduced brain and peripheral α-Synuclein and p-Tau and modulated blood 
immunological responses. TKIs did not affect brain IL-10, but they changed the 
levels of all measured blood immune markers, except CX3CL1. TKIs altered 
microglia morphology and reduced the number of astrocyte and dendritic cells, 
suggesting beneficial regulation of microglia.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that tyrosine kinase inhibition affects 
neuro-inflammation via early changes of the peripheral immune profile, leading 
to modulation of the neuro-immune response to α-Synuclein and p-Tau.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Late-onset 
AD (LOAD), is the most common form of Alzheimer's disease, representing about 
>95% of cases and early-onset AD represents <5% of cases. Several risk factors 
have been discovered that are associated with AD, with advancing age being the 
most prominent. Other environmental risk factors include diabetes mellitus, 
level of physical activity, educational status, hypertension and head injury. 
The most well known genetic risk factor for LOAD is inheritance of the 
apolipoprotein (apo) E4 allele. Recently, rare variants of TREM2 have been 
reported as a significant risk factor for LOAD, comparable to inheritance of 
apoE4. In this review we will focus on the role(s) of TREM2 in AD as well as in 
other neurodegenerative disorders.

Rivastigmine from capsules to patch: therapeutic advances in the management of 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia.

Sadowsky); Private Practice, Marietta, Georgia (Dr Micca); Department of 
Neurology and Psychiatry, St Louis University School of Medicine, St Louis, 
Missouri (Dr Grossberg); and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, 
New Jersey (Dr Velting).

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pharmacology, mechanism of action, and chemical 
properties of the cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) rivastigmine; to provide a 
rationale for transdermal delivery and supportive clinical data, along with 
practical guidance on rivastigmine patch use in Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's disease dementia.
DATA SOURCES: Pivotal studies of rivastigmine capsules and patch were identified 
using PubMed and the rivastigmine US prescribing information. PubMed searches 
were performed in 2013 using rivastigmine as a keyword.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language articles related to rivastigmine considered of 
relevance to primary care physicians were included.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmacologic differences exist between rivastigmine and ChEIs. 
Clinical studies demonstrate symptomatic efficacy of oral rivastigmine across 
all stages of Alzheimer's disease and mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease 
dementia. However, gastrointestinal adverse events limit access to optimal 
therapeutic doses. Strategies that lower maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) 
and prolong time to Cmax, ie, transdermal delivery, may improve tolerability. 
Clinical registration studies have demonstrated improved tolerability of 
rivastigmine 9.5-mg/24-h patch versus 6-mg twice-daily capsules in 
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and a positive benefit-risk profile of 
13.3-mg/24-h versus 9.5-mg/24-h patch in patients needing enhanced efficacy. 
Clinical data comparing 13.3-mg/24-h versus 4.6-mg/24-h patch in severe 
Alzheimer's disease demonstrated efficacy on cognition and activities of daily 
living. These data led to approval of rivastigmine patch in severe Alzheimer's 
disease. Transdermal delivery also has practical advantages, including simple, 
once-daily administration and a visual indicator of compliance. Potential 
application site reactions can be minimized and need not be a barrier to 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to practical advantages, rivastigmine patch may improve 
clinical outcomes throughout the course of Alzheimer's disease by providing 
access to high-dose efficacy without compromising tolerability.

A number of small studies and anecdotal reports have been suggested that sports 
involving repeated head trauma may have long-term risks of neurodegenerative 
disease. There are now plausible mechanisms for these effects, and a recognition 
that these problems do not just occur in former boxers, but in a variety of 
sports involving repeated concussions, and possibly also in sports in which 
low-level head trauma is common. These neurodegenerative effects potentially 
include increased risks of impaired cognitive function and dementia, Parkinson's 
disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many would argue for taking a 
precautionary approach and immediately banning or restricting sports such as 
boxing. However, there are important public health issues in terms of how wide 
the net should be cast in terms of other sports, and what remedial measures 
could be taken? This in turn requires a major research effort involving both 
clinical and basic research to understand the underlying mechanisms, leading 
from head trauma to neurodegenerative disease and epidemiologic studies to 
assess the long-term consequences.

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) as a marker of neurodegenerative disorders.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can occur in the absence 
of any other obvious associated neurologic disorder or in association with a 
neurodegenerative disease, in which case it is considered as symptomatic RBD. 
RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia 
or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the 
occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, 
RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at 
neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found 
evidence of CNS dysfunction during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable 
proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying 
subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be 
crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective 
results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neurodegeneration are the 
following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 
123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.

For over a century, researchers have observed similar neurodegenerative 
hallmarks in brains of people affected by rare early-onset lysosomal storage 
diseases and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's disease. Increasing evidence suggests these apparently disparate 
diseases share a common underlying feature, namely, a dysfunctional clearance of 
cellular cargo through the secretory-endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal-exocytic 
(SEALE) network. By providing examples of rare and common neurodegenerative 
diseases known to have pathologically altered cargo flux through the SEALE 
network, we explore the unifying hypothesis that impaired catabolism or 
exocytosis of SEALE cargo, places a burden of stress on neurons that initiates 
pathogenesis. We also describe how a growing understanding of genetic, 
epigenetic and age-related modifications of the SEALE network, has inspired a 
number of novel disease-modifying therapeutic approaches aimed at alleviating 
SEALE storage and providing therapeutic benefit to people affected by these 
devastating diseases across the age spectrum.

Introduction Loss of smell is involved in various neurologic and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. 
However, the olfactory test is usually neglected by physicians at large. 
Objective The aim of this study was to review the current literature about the 
relationship between olfactory dysfunction and neurologic and neurodegenerative 
diseases. Data Synthesis Twenty-seven studies were selected for analysis, and 
the olfactory system, olfaction, and the association between the olfactory 
dysfunction and dementias were reviewed. Furthermore, is described an up to date 
in olfaction. Conclusion Otolaryngologist should remember the importance of 
olfaction evaluation in daily practice. Furthermore, neurologists and physicians 
in general should include olfactory tests in the screening of those at higher 
risk of dementia.

University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease 
of bone (PDB) and/or frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is characterized by 
adult-onset proximal and distal muscle weakness (clinically resembling a 
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy syndrome), early-onset PDB, and premature 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Muscle weakness progresses to involve other limb 
and respiratory muscles. PDB involves focal areas of increased bone turnover 
that typically lead to spine and/or hip pain and localized enlargement and 
deformity of the long bones; pathologic fractures occur on occasion. Early 
stages of FTD are characterized by dysnomia, dyscalculia, comprehension 
deficits, and paraphasic errors, with minimal impairment of episodic memory; 
later stages are characterized by inability to speak, auditory comprehension 
deficits for even one-step commands, alexia, and agraphia. Mean age at diagnosis 
for muscle disease and PDB is 42 years; for FTD, 56 years. Dilated 
cardiomyopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease are now 
known to be part of the spectrum of findings associated with IBMPFD.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of IBMPFD is established in a proband with 
typical clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in HNRNPA1, 
HNRNPA2B1, or VCP identified by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Weight control to avoid obesity; 
physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent 
contractures; mechanical aids (canes, walkers, orthotics, wheelchairs) for 
ambulation/mobility; surgical intervention for foot deformity and scoliosis; 
respiratory aids when indicated; social and emotional support; assisted living 
arrangements for muscle weakness and/or dementia; bisphosphonates to relieve 
pain and disability from PDB. Surveillance: At periodic intervals: 
echocardiogram and EKG to monitor for evidence of cardiomyopathy; pulmonary 
function studies; sleep study; alkaline phosphatase, skeletal x-rays and bone 
scans to monitor for PDB onset and effectiveness of therapy; assessment of 
behavior and mental status.
GENETIC COUNSELING: IBMPFD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An 
estimated 80% of affected individuals have an affected parent; approximately 20% 
have the disorder as a result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an 
individual with IBMPFD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. 
Once the IBMPFD-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected 
family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The spectrum of GRN frontotemporal dementia (GRN-FTD) 
includes the behavioral variant (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA; 
further subcategorized as progressive nonfluent aphasia [PNFA] and semantic 
dementia [SD]), and movement disorders with extrapyramidal features such as 
parkinsonism and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). A broad range of clinical features 
both within and between families is observed. The age of onset ranges from 35 to 
87 years. Behavioral disturbances are the most common early feature, followed by 
progressive aphasia. Impairment in executive function manifests as loss of 
judgment and insight. In early stages, PPA often manifests as deficits in 
naming, word finding, or word comprehension. In late stages, affected 
individuals often become mute and lose their ability to communicate. Early 
findings of parkinsonism include rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia (slowing or 
absence of movements), limb dystonia, apraxia (loss of ability to carry out 
learned purposeful movements), and disequilibrium. Late motor findings may 
include myoclonus, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Most affected individuals 
eventually lose the ability to walk. Disease duration is three to 12 years.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of GRN-FTD is established in a proband with 
suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GRN identified by 
molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Behavioral manifestations such as 
apathy, impulsivity, and compulsiveness may respond to selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors. Roaming, delusions, and hallucinations may respond to 
antipsychotic medications. Reports have suggested potential benefits with 
certain pharmacotherapy on management of FTD; however, evidence from randomized 
controlled trials is limited. Small-scale studies have suggested that trazodone 
may be helpful for treating irritability, agitation, depression, and eating 
disorders; methylphenidate and dextro-amphetamine may help minimize risk-taking 
behavior. Cholinesterase inhibitors examined in clinical trials were generally 
well tolerated: galantamine was used to treat PPA with stabilization of 
symptoms; rivastigmine was used to treat behavioral manifestations and appeared 
to decrease caregiver burden. Two open-label studies of memantine, an NMDA 
partial agonist-antagonist, demonstrated some efficacy on frontal behavior in 
those with bvFTD and improvement in cognitive performance in those with 
PPA-PNFA.
GENETIC COUNSELING: GRN-FTD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 
95% of individuals diagnosed with GRN-FTD have an affected parent. The 
proportion of affected individuals with a de novo GRN pathogenic variant is 
unknown but is estimated to be 5% or fewer. Each child of an individual with 
GRN-FTD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once a GRN 
pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal 
testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing 
are possible.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers) is a 
multisystem disorder characterized by myoclonus (often the first symptom) 
followed by generalized epilepsy, ataxia, weakness, exercise intolerance, and 
dementia. Onset can occur from childhood to adulthood, occurring after normal 
early development. Common findings are ptosis, hearing loss, short stature, 
optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias such as 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. Pigmentary 
retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, and lipomatosis have been 
observed.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: A clinical diagnosis of MERRF can be established in a proband 
with the following four "canonic" features: myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, 
ataxia, and ragged red fibers (RRF) in the muscle biopsy. A molecular diagnosis 
is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a pathogenic variant in 
one of the genes associated with MERRF. The m.8344A>G pathogenic variant in the 
mitochondrial gene MT-TK is present in more than 80% of affected individuals 
with typical findings. Pathogenic variants in MT-TF, MT-TH, MT-TI, MT-TL1, 
MT-TP, MT-TS1, and MT-TS2 have also been described in a subset of individuals 
with MERRF.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Ubiquinol, carnitine, alpha lipoic 
acid, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, and creatine may be of benefit to some 
individuals; traditional anticonvulsant therapy per neurologist for seizures; 
levetiracetam or clonazepam for myoclonus; physical therapy to improve any 
impaired motor function; aerobic exercise; standard pharmacologic therapy for 
cardiac symptoms; hearing aids or cochlear implants for hearing loss; diabetes 
mellitus treatment per endocrinologist. Prevention of primary manifestations: 
Coenzyme Q10 (50-200 mg 2-3x/day), L-carnitine (1000 mg 2-3x/day), alpha lipoic 
acid, vitamin E, vitamin B supplements, and creatine, often used to improve 
mitochondrial function, have been of modest benefit in some individuals. Doses 
for children should be adjusted appropriately. Surveillance: Routine evaluations 
every six to 12 months initially; annual neurologic, ophthalmologic, cardiology 
(electrocardiogram and echocardiogram), and endocrinologic evaluations (fasting 
blood sugar and TSH); audiology evaluations every two to three years. 
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mitochondrial toxins (e.g., aminoglycoside 
antibiotics, linezolid, cigarettes, alcohol); valproic acid should be avoided in 
the treatment of seizures. Pregnancy management: During pregnancy, affected or 
at-risk women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory 
insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions.
GENETIC COUNSELING: MERRF is caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA and is 
transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of 
having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the 
mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. A male with a mtDNA 
pathogenic variant cannot transmit the pathogenic variant to any of his 
offspring. A female with a mtDNA pathogenic variant (whether symptomatic or 
asymptomatic) transmits the pathogenic variant to all of her offspring. Prenatal 
testing and preimplantation genetic testing for MERRF are possible if a mtDNA 
pathogenic variant has been detected in the mother. However, because the 
mutational load in embryonic and fetal tissues sampled (i.e., amniocytes and 
chorionic villi) may not correspond to that of all fetal tissues and because the 
mutational load in tissues sampled prenatally may shift in utero or after birth 
as a result of random mitotic segregation, prediction of the phenotype from 
prenatal studies is not possible.

and Neurology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mitochondrial membrane protein-associated 
neurodegeneration (MPAN) is characterized initially by gait changes followed by 
progressive spastic paresis, progressive dystonia (which may be limited to the 
hands and feet or more generalized), neuropsychiatric abnormalities (emotional 
lability, depression, anxiety, impulsivity, compulsions, hallucinations, 
perseveration, inattention, and hyperactivity), and cognitive decline. 
Additional early findings can include dysphagia, dysarthria, optic atrophy, 
axonal neuropathy, parkinsonism, and bowel/bladder incontinence. Survival is 
usually well into adulthood. End-stage disease is characterized by severe 
dementia, spasticity, dystonia, and parkinsonism.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPAN is typically established in a proband 
with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants (or less commonly a 
heterozygous pathogenic variant) in C19orf12 identified by molecular genetic 
testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Pharmacologic treatment of spasticity, 
dystonia, and parkinsonism; psychiatric treatment of significant 
neuropsychiatric manifestations; physical, occupational, speech, and other 
therapies as indicated; nutritional supplements and gastric tube feeding as 
needed; management of excessive secretions and aspiration risk with 
glycopyrrolate, transdermal scopolamine patch, and/or tracheostomy as indicated. 
Surveillance: Routine follow up by a neurologist for medication management and 
interval assessment of ambulation, speech, and swallowing (often done every 3-6 
months, but may be annual for individuals who are more stable); routine 
monitoring by occupational therapy / physical therapy, mental health providers, 
ophthalmology, speech and language therapy, and feeding team is recommended; 
routine assessment of educational needs and social support.
GENETIC COUNSELING: MPAN is inherited in an autosomal recessive or (less 
commonly) autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive MPAN. If both parents 
are known to be heterozygous for an C19orf12 pathogenic variant, each sib of an 
affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% 
chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected 
and not a carrier. Autosomal dominant MPAN. Each child of an affected individual 
has a 50% chance of inheriting the C19orf12 pathogenic variant. Once the 
C19orf12 pathogenic variant(s) in the family have been identified in an affected 
family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

(3)Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The spectrum of DCTN1-related neurodegeneration 
includes Perry syndrome, distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type 7B (dHMN7B), 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), motor neuron disease / amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), and progressive supranuclear palsy. Some individuals present 
with overlapping phenotypes (e.g., FTD-ALS, Perry syndrome-dHMN7B). Perry 
syndrome (the most common of the phenotypes associated with DCTN1) is 
characterized by parkinsonism, neuropsychiatric symptoms, hypoventilation, and 
weight loss. The mean age of onset in those with Perry syndrome is 49 years 
(range: 35-70 years), and the mean disease duration is five years (range: 2-14 
years). In most affected persons, the reported cause/circumstance of death 
relates to sudden death/hypoventilation or suicide.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of DCTN1-related neurodegeneration is 
established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous DCTN1 pathogenic 
variant on molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Dopaminergic therapy in individuals 
with significant parkinsonism; ventilation support; anti depressants and 
psychiatric care for depression; high caloric intake for weight loss; feeding 
tube when needed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and provide adequate caloric 
intake; arytenoidectomy for vocal cord paralysis to provide a larger airway for 
respiration; orthosis for neuropathic foot. Surveillance: Evaluation of weight 
and calorie intake, respiratory function (particularly at night or during 
sleep), motor function, and mood/personality changes annually or more frequently 
as needed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Central respiratory depressants (e.g., 
benzodiazepines, alcohol, narcotics).
GENETIC COUNSELING: DCTN1-related neurodegeneration is inherited in an autosomal 
dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with DCTN1-related neurodegeneration 
have an affected parent. Less commonly, individuals diagnosed with DCTN1-related 
neurodegeneration have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic 
variant. Each child of an individual with DCTN1-related neurodegeneration has a 
50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the DCTN1 pathogenic 
variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a 
pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for 
DCTN1-related neurodegeneration are possible.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences Medical School University 
of Siena Siena, Italy

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid 
storage disease characterized by infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset 
cataract, adolescent- to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset 
progressive neurologic dysfunction (dementia, psychiatric disturbances, 
pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, dystonia, atypical parkinsonism, peripheral 
neuropathy, and seizures). Chronic diarrhea from infancy and/or neonatal 
cholestasis may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of 
affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the 
first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur 
on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar 
tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones, 
and central nervous system. Some individuals show cognitive impairment from 
early infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly impaired 
intellectual function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in 
intellectual abilities occurs in the third decade in more than 50% of 
individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioral changes, 
hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicide attempts may be 
prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e., spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost 
invariably become evident between ages 20 and 30 years. The biochemical 
abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include 
high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma 
cholesterol concentration, decreased chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), increased 
concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates, and increased 
concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CTX is established in a proband with 
suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in CYP27A1 identified on 
molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Long-term treatment with CDCA 
normalizes plasma and CSF concentration of cholestanol and improves 
neurophysiologic findings. Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase alone or in 
combination with CDCA are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration 
and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce muscle damage. Cholic 
acid treatment decreases cholestanol levels and improves neurologic symptoms in 
the few individuals in whom it has been tried and may be useful in those who 
experience side effects with CDCA treatments. Cataract extraction is typically 
required in at least one eye by age 50 years. Epilepsy, spasticity, and 
parkinsonism are treated symptomatically. Prevention of primary manifestations: 
Early treatment with CDCA in presymptomatic individuals appears to prevent 
clinical manifestations. Surveillance: Annual cholestanol plasma concentration, 
neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation, brain MRI, echocardiogram, and 
assessment of bone density. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Caution has been 
suggested with statins. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to 
clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk 
relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible 
those who would benefit from prompt initiation of CDCA treatment and 
surveillance. Pregnancy management: Treatment with CDCA should not be 
interrupted during pregnancy.
GENETIC COUNSELING: CTX is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both 
parents are known to be heterozygous for a CYP27A1 pathogenic variant, each sib 
of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 
50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the 
familial pathogenic variants. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and 
prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if both CYP27A1 
pathogenic variants in the family are known.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is 
characterized by ataxia, dementia, and involuntary movements, including chorea 
and dystonia. Psychiatric symptoms, pyramidal signs, and rigidity are common. 
The age of onset ranges from three to 55 years. Individuals with full-penetrance 
alleles develop neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms by age 50 years. Ataxia 
and psychiatric abnormalities are frequently the initial findings, followed by 
involuntary movement, parkinsonism, dementia, and pyramidal signs. Brain MRI 
shows variable atrophy of the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum. The clinical 
features correlate with the length of the polyglutamine expansion but are not 
absolutely predictive of the clinical course.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SCA17 is established in a proband by 
identification of an abnormal CAG/CAA repeat expansion in TBP. Affected 
individuals usually have more than 41 repeats. The CAA and CAG codons both 
encode glutamine residues resulting in a pathogenic polyglutamine expansion.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Psychotropic medications for 
psychiatric issues, anti-seizure medication for seizures (ASM); botulinum toxin 
injections for dystonia; adaptation of the environment to accommodate dementia. 
Prevention of secondary complications: Side effects of psychotropic medications 
and ASMs may require total or intermittent discontinuation of the treatment or 
reduction in dose. Surveillance: Annual or semiannual evaluation by a 
neurologist or more frequently if symptoms are progressing rapidly. 
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sedative/hypnotic agents, such as ethanol or 
certain medications, may exacerbate incoordination.
GENETIC COUNSELING: SCA17 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 
Offspring of affected individuals are at a 50% risk of inheriting the expanded 
TBP allele. The age of onset, severity, specific symptoms, and progression of 
the disease are variable and cannot be precisely predicted by family history or 
size of expansion. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the diagnosis has been 
established in an affected family member by molecular genetic testing.

School, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The spectrum of clinical manifestations of 
MAPT-related frontotemporal dementia (MAPT-FTD) has expanded from its original 
description of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonian manifestations to 
include changes in behavior, motor function, memory, and/or language. A recent 
retrospective study suggested that the majority of affected individuals have 
either behavioral changes consistent with a diagnosis of behavioral variant FTD 
(bvFTD) or, less commonly, a parkinsonian syndrome (i.e., progressive 
supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, or Parkinson disease). Fewer than 5% 
of people with MAPT-FTD have primary progressive aphasia or Alzheimer disease. 
Clinical presentation may differ between and within families with the same MAPT 
variant. MAPT-FTD is a progressive disorder that commonly ends with a relatively 
global dementia in which some affected individuals become mute. Progression of 
motor impairment in affected individuals results in some becoming chairbound and 
others bedbound. Mean disease duration is 9.3 (SD: 6.4) years but is 
individually variable and can be more than 30 years in some instances.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MAPT-FTD is established in a proband with 
suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variant 
in MAPT identified by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for MAPT-FTD. 
Supportive care to improve quality of life, maximize function, and reduce 
complications is recommended. This can involve multidisciplinary care that often 
includes a neurologist, specially trained nurses, speech-language pathologist or 
therapist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, 
psychiatrist/psychologist, social worker, and genetic counselor. Surveillance: 
To monitor existing manifestations, the individual's response to supportive 
care, and the emergence of new manifestations, routine evaluations by 
multidisciplinary specialists are recommended.
GENETIC COUNSELING: MAPT-FTD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most 
individuals diagnosed with MAPT-FTD have an affected parent with the clinical 
features of FTD and/or parkinsonism; however, because of the late onset and 
relatively rapid course of the disease, the affected parent often dies before 
onset of the disease in the offspring. A proband with MAPT-FTD may have the 
disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; such variants have been 
reported but are thought to be rare. Once the MAPT pathogenic variant has been 
identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic 
testing are possible.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: In this GeneReview, TARDBP amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (TARDBP-ALS-FTD) refers to the spectrum of 
phenotypes caused by pathogenic variants in TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43. 
The phenotypic spectrum encompasses pure (i.e., without other neurologic 
findings) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; most common), pure (i.e., without 
other neurologic findings) frontotemporal dementia (FTD; rare), a combination of 
ALS and FTD, and atypical neurologic phenotypes (very rare). Individuals with 
the same TARDBP pathogenic variant (even within the same family) may have 
clinical features that vary in both type and severity. Common manifestations are 
dysarthria and dysphagia; less common manifestations can include parkinsonism, 
cognitive deterioration, and behavioral and psychological manifestations of 
dementia. Life expectancy for TARDBP-ALS is highly variable and mainly 
associated with an individual's clinical features; overall disease duration 
averages three to five years. For TARDBP-FTD, disease duration averages one to 
16 years.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of TARDBP-ALS-FTD is established in a proband 
with suggestive findings and most commonly a heterozygous pathogenic (or likely 
pathogenic) variant in TARDBP identified by molecular genetic testing. Rarely, 
homozygous pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in TARDBP have been 
reported.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: There is no cure for TARDBP-ALS-FTD. 
Individuals benefit from multidisciplinary supportive care to improve quality of 
life, maximize function, and reduce complications. This can include care by 
specialists in neurology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language 
therapy, nutrition, respiratory therapy, pulmonology, psychology, social work, 
genetic counselling, palliative care, and special nursing. Surveillance: 
Frequent monitoring of existing manifestations, the individual's response to 
supportive care, and the emergence of new manifestations by the treating 
clinicians is recommended.
GENETIC COUNSELING: TARDBP-ALS-FTD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 
About half of individuals diagnosed with TARDBP-ALS-FTD have an affected parent. 
Each child of an individual with TARDBP-ALS-FTD has a 50% chance of inheriting 
the TARDBP pathogenic variant. Once a TARDBP pathogenic variant has been 
identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk 
relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for the presence of 
the TARDBP pathogenic variant are possible. (Note: Because the clinical 
presentation of TARDBP-ALS-FTD may differ among heterozygous family members, 
accurate prediction of future possible clinical manifestations in an individual 
found to have a familial TARDBP pathogenic variant is not possible.)

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: VPS35-related Parkinson disease (PARK-VPS35) is 
indistinguishable from Parkinson disease of unknown cause representing a simplex 
case (also referred to as "sporadic" Parkinson disease). PARK-VPS35 is 
characterized by typical parkinsonism (resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, 
disturbance of postural reflexes) presenting on average a decade earlier than in 
individuals with simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause. Median age of onset 
is approximately 50 years, with a range of onset spanning the third to eighth 
decade of life. PARK-VPS35 subtypes can include tremor dominant, akinetic rigid, 
gait difficulty, or mixed. Asymmetric presentation is typical. The disease 
course is usually milder than that of simplex Parkinson disease of unknown 
cause, with a decreased incidence of atypical signs. Dyskinesia and motor 
fluctuations may occur. Neuropsychiatric manifestations (depression and 
schizophrenia), learning difficulties, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia 
have been reported, albeit with lower occurrence than in simplex Parkinson 
disease of unknown cause. Additional findings include impaired sense of smell 
and autonomic manifestations including orthostasis and constipation.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of PARK-VPS35 is established in a proband with 
parkinsonism (bradykinesia with rigidity and/or resting tremor) and a 
heterozygous VPS35 pathogenic variant identified by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: To date, treatment of PARK-VPS35 does 
not differ from that of simplex Parkinson disease of unknown cause. Drugs to 
treat motor manifestations include levodopa, in combination with a peripheral 
dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa, benserazide), dopamine agonists, 
inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase-B, 
anticholinergics, and amantadine. Most individuals respond well to levodopa and 
other dopaminergic medications. Individuals benefit from physical, occupational, 
and speech therapies. Due to the lower risk of atypical signs, neuropsychiatric 
disturbances, and dementia, individuals with PARK-VPS35 seem to be good 
candidates for treatment with dopamine agonists. In addition, in those with 
dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, subthalamic deep brain stimulation and 
apomorphine intermittent injections or continuous therapy with an infusion pump 
should be considered. Peak-dose dyskinesia may be ameliorated with amantadine 
and dopaminergic treatment reduction (if tolerated). Low-dose clozapine, 
quetiapine, or pimavanserin and reduction of dopaminergic therapy can decrease 
delusions and hallucinations. Standard treatments for depression; consider 
droxidopa for orthostasis; symptomatic treatment for constipation. Surveillance: 
Neurologic evaluations to assess tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait, 
neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition, and treatment efficacy every six to 12 
months or as needed; neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments as needed; 
assess for symptoms of orthostasis, measure blood pressure, and assess for 
constipation at each visit; echocardiogram as needed in those treated with 
ergot-derived dopamine agonists; assess family and social work needs at each 
visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that may induce or exacerbate 
parkinsonism include but are not limited to neuroleptics, antidepressants, 
calcium channel blockers, valproate, lithium, and amiodarone. Ergot-derived 
dopaminergic drugs should be discontinued if fibrotic heart-valve changes are 
identified.
GENETIC COUNSELING: PARK-VPS35 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 
About 90% of individuals diagnosed with PARK-VPS35 have positive family history 
of Parkinson disease. Each child of an individual with PARK-VPS35 has a 50% 
chance of inheriting the VPS35 pathogenic variant. Once the VPS35 pathogenic 
variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and 
preimplantation genetic testing are possible.
