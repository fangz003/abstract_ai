Psychosis has been recognized as a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases 
and a core feature of dementia that worsens most clinical courses. It includes 
hallucinations, delusions including paranoia, aggressive behaviour, apathy and 
other psychotic phenomena that occur in a wide range of degenerative disorders 
including Alzheimer's disease, synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, dementia 
with Lewy bodies), Huntington's disease, frontotemporal degenerations, 
motoneuron and prion diseases. Many of these psychiatric manifestations may be 
early expressions of cognitive impairment, but often there is a dissociation 
between psychotic/behavioural symptoms and the rather linear decline in 
cognitive function, suggesting independent pathophysiological mechanisms. 
Strictly neuropathological explanations are likely to be insufficient to explain 
them, and a large group of heterogeneous factors (environmental, neurochemical 
changes, genetic factors, etc.) may influence their pathogenesis. 
Clinico-pathological evaluation of behavioural and psychotic symptoms (PS) in 
the setting of neurodegenerative and dementing disorders presents a significant 
challenge for modern neurosciences. Recognition and understanding of these 
manifestations may lead to the development of more effective preventive and 
therapeutic options that can serve to delay long-term progression of these 
devastating disorders and improve the patients' quality of life. A better 
understanding of the pathophysiology and distinctive pathological features 
underlying the development of PS in neurodegenerative diseases may provide 
important insights into psychotic processes in general.

AIMS: We aimed to describe cases with incidental neuropathological findings of 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) from the Banner Sun Health Research 
Institute Brain and Body Donation Program.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 277 subjects with longitudinal 
motor and neuropsychological assessments who came to autopsy. The mean 
Gallyas-positive PSP features grading for subjects with possible incidental 
neuropathological PSP was compared to those of subjects with clinically manifest 
disease.
RESULTS: There were 5 cases with histopathological findings suggestive of PSP, 
but no parkinsonism, dementia or movement disorder during life. Cognitive 
evaluation revealed 4 of the 5 cases to be cognitively normal; one case had 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in her last year of life. The mean age 
at death of the 5 cases was 88.9 years (range 80-94). All 5 individuals had 
histopathologic microscopic findings suggestive of PSP. Mean Gallyas-positive 
PSP features grading was significantly lower in subjects with possible 
incidental neuropathological PSP than subjects with clinical PSP, particularly 
in the subthalamic nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: We present 5 patients with histopathological findings suggestive of 
PSP, without clinical PSP, dementia or parkinsonism during life. These 
incidental neuropathological PSP findings may represent the early or 
pre-symptomatic stage of PSP. The mean Gallyas-positive PSP features grading was 
significantly lower in possible incidental PSP than in clinical PSP, thus 
suggesting that a threshold of pathological burden needs to be reached within 
the typically affected areas in PSP before clinical signs and symptoms appear.

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, imaging, and neuropsychological characteristics 
and longitudinal course of subjects with pre-mild cognitive impairment 
(pre-MCI), who exhibit features of MCI on clinical examination but lack 
impairment on neuropsychological examination, to subjects with no cognitive 
impairment (NCI), nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), amnestic MCI (aMCI), and mild 
dementia.
METHODS: For 369 subjects, clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB), ApoE 
genotyping, cardiovascular risk factors, parkinsonism (UPDRS) scores, structural 
brain MRIs, and neuropsychological testing were obtained at baseline, whereas 
275 of these subjects received an annual follow-up for 2-3 years.
RESULTS: At baseline, pre-MCI subjects showed impairment on tests of executive 
function and language, higher apathy scores, and lower left hippocampal volumes 
(HPCV) in comparison to NCI subjects. Pre-MCI subjects showed less impairment on 
at least one memory measure, CDR-SB and UPDRS scores, in comparison to naMCI, 
aMCI and mild dementia subjects. Follow-up over 2-3 years showed 28.6% of 
pre-MCI subjects, but less than 5% of NCI subjects progressed to MCI or 
dementia. Progression rates to dementia were equivalent between naMCI (22.2%) 
and aMCI (34.5%) groups, but greater than for the pre-MCI group (2.4%). 
Progression to dementia was best predicted by the CDR-SB, a list learning and 
executive function test.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that clinically defined pre-MCI has 
cognitive, functional, motor, behavioral and imaging features that are 
intermediate between NCI and MCI states at baseline. Pre-MCI subjects showed 
accelerated rates of progression to MCI as compared to NCI subjects, but slower 
rates of progression to dementia than MCI subjects.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the components of the neuroticism trait most responsible 
for its association with cognitive decline and dementia in old age.
DESIGN: Longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study.
SETTING: Chicago metropolitan area.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 785 older persons without dementia completed standard 
self-report measures of six components of neuroticism and then had annual 
clinical evaluations for a mean of 3.4 years and brain autopsy in the event of 
death.
MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD), change 
in global and specific cognitive functions, and postmortem measures of plaques 
and tangles, cerebral infarction, and Lewy bodies.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 94 individuals developed AD. Higher levels of anxiety 
and vulnerability to stress were associated with increased risk of AD and more 
rapid decline in global cognition, with no effects for the other four trait 
components. In analyses of specific cognitive systems, neuroticism subscales 
were related to decline in episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual 
speed, but not in semantic memory or visuospatial ability. No component of 
neuroticism was related to the neuropathologic lesions most commonly associated 
with late-life dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism's association with late-life dementia mainly reflects 
vulnerability to stress and anxiety and their correlation with decline in the 
ability to process and retain new information.

[Drug treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease 
dementia--common features and differences].

Dementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are no 
rare causes of dementia. Both have neuropathologically, clinically, and 
neurochemically much in common. In the course of both conditions frequently 
psychotic symptoms occur, often induced by antiparkinsonian medication. 
Treatment of psychotic features with conventional antipsychotics is not 
tolerated in many cases. Therefore low-dose clozapine treatment is acknowledged 
usual practise for psychosis in Parkinson's disease and a case report indicates 
efficacy for psychosis in DLB, too. All other atypical antipsychotics except 
risperidone are not licensed for dementia in Germany, but risperidone is 
contraindicated in DLB due to manufacturer's notice and usually not well 
tolerated in DLB and Parkinson's disease. Open trials indicate safety for 
treatment of psychosis in DLB and PDD with quetiapine. Randomized controlled 
trials indicate, that quetiapine is less effective than clozapine against 
psychotic symptoms in both conditions, although comparatively safe. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors, especially rivastigmine, are a therapeutic 
alternative for treating both psychotic and cognitive symptoms in both 
conditions. Parkinsonism in DLB-patients responds worse to levodopa compared to 
patient with Parkinson's disease. Anticholinergic drugs often induce delirium in 
demented patients and therefore should be avoided. The same problem is 
associated with dopamine agonists in PDD and DLB. Amantadine, a NMDA-receptor 
antagonist like memantine, potentially bears the same risk of worsening 
psychotic symptoms. The following preliminary recommendation for drug treatment 
of PDD and DLB can be given: Stop all anticholinergic medication and reduce 
levodopa and other antiparkinsonian medication to the tolerated minimum. 
Levodopa alone is preferred. Treat with cholinesterase inhibitors to the maximum 
tolerated dose. If there is no adequate response regarding psychotic symptoms, 
add quetiapine. If this approach fails, replace quetiapine by low-dose 
clozapine. If behavioural disturbances are due to depression, anxiety, or 
irritability, treatment with an antidepressant, preferably citalopram, is an 
option.

Knowing me, knowing you: can a knowledge of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease 
prove useful in understanding the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease?

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common 
neurodegenerative disorders. Why some individuals develop one disease rather 
than the other is not clear. Association studies with a case-control design are 
the time-honored approach to identifying risk factors. Extensive association 
studies have been carried out in both diseases creating a large knowledge 
database, however, reproducible risk factors remain rare. This general lack of 
knowledge of pathogenesis prevents us from reducing the worldwide burden of 
these diseases. Case-control studies are reductionist paradigms that assume, for 
maximum power, that the two populations being compared are exclusive and 
homogenous. The common occurrence of incidental AD and PD-type pathology 
combined with 'intermediate phenotypes' such as dementia with Lewy bodies 
suggest that aging itself, AD, and PD are part of a complex continuum 
characterized by variable amounts of amyloid-β, tau, and α-synuclein pathology. 
This heterogeneity may be a contributor to the lack of reproducibility in 
association studies to date. Here, we speculate on alternative experimental 
approaches to the case-control paradigm and consider how the association-study 
literature for AD and PD might be re-interpreted in terms of a disease spectrum.

The role of biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases has been emphasized by 
recent research. Future clinical demands for identifying diseases at an early 
stage may render them essential. The aim of this pilot study was to test the 
analytical performance of two multiplex assays of cerebral markers on a 
well-defined clinical material consisting of patients with various 
neurodegenerative diseases. We measured 10 analytes in plasma and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) from 60 patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular 
dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or mild cognitive 
impairment, as well as 20 cognitively healthy controls. We used the Randox 
biochip-based Evidence Investigator™ system to measure the analytes. We found it 
possible to measure most analytes in both plasma and CSF, and there were some 
interesting differences between the diagnostic groups, although with large 
overlaps. CSF heart-type fatty acid-binding protein was increased in AD. Glial 
fibrillary acidic protein and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in CSF 
and D-dimer in plasma were elevated in patients with cerebrovascular disease. A 
multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the pattern of analytes could 
help to differentiate the conditions, although more studies are required to 
verify this.

Age-related ventricular enlargement is accelerated in Alzheimer's disease, but 
its relationship to cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is less clear, even 
though dementia is common in Parkinson's disease. Our goals were to determine if 
greater enlargement of the ventricles and gray or white matter atrophy occurred 
in Parkinson's disease patients developing cognitive decline. Older nondemented 
patients with Parkinson's disease (33) and age- and sex-matched controls (39) 
were recruited and prospectively assessed for the development of significant 
cognitive decline over 36 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained every 
18 months, and ventricular volume and total brain gray and white matter volumes 
were measured using reliable segmentation of T1-weighted volumetric scans. 
Subjects with incidental intracranial abnormalities, an atypical course, and 
stroke as well as dropouts were excluded from a cohort of 52 patients and 50 
controls. Among 33 patients and 39 controls, 10 patients and 3 controls 
developed significant cognitive impairment or dementia. Ventricular change and 
Parkinson's disease status were significantly associated with dementia. 
Ventricular change was significantly correlated with change in Mini-Mental 
Status Examination in the Parkinson's disease with dementia group (r = 0.87, P = 
.001). Gray matter atrophy was greater in Parkinson's disease with dementia, 
with similar change over time in both Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's 
disease with dementia. White matter volumes were not significantly different 
between Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease with dementia; however, the 
decrease over time might be greater in Parkinson's disease with dementia. 
Ventricular dilatation occurs early in the course of significant cognitive 
decline in patients with Parkinson's disease, possibly reflecting both cortical 
gray and white matter loss.

Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks.

Brain diseases and their treatment may help or hurt creativity in ways that 
shape quality of life. Increased creative drive is associated with bipolar 
disorder, depression, psychosis, temporal lobe epilepsy, frontotemporal 
dementia, Parkinson disease treatments, and autism. Creativity depends on 
goal-driven approach motivation from midbrain dopaminergic systems. Fear-driven 
avoidance motivation is of less aid to creativity. When serotonin and 
norepinephrine lower motivation and flexible behaviour, they can inhibit 
creativity. Hemispheric lateralization and frontotemporal connections must 
interact to create new ideas and conceptual schemes. The right brain and 
temporal lobe contribute skill in novelty detection, while the left brain and 
frontal lobe foster approach motivation and more easily generate new patterns of 
action from the novel perceptions. Genes and phenotypes that increase plasticity 
and creativity in tolerant environments with relaxed selection pressure may 
confer risk in rigorous environments. Few papers substantively address this 
important but fraught topic. Antidepressants (ADs) that inhibit fear-driven 
motivation, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sometimes inhibit 
goal-oriented motivation as well. ADs that boost goal-directed motivation, such 
as bupropion, may remediate this effect. Benzodiazepines and alcohol may be 
counterproductive. Although dopaminergic agonists sometimes stimulate 
creativity, their doing so may inappropriately disinhibit behaviour. Dopamine 
antagonists may suppress creative motivation; lithium and anticonvulsant mood 
stabilizers may do so less. Physical exercise and REM sleep may help creativity. 
Art therapy and psychotherapy are not well studied. Preserving creative 
motivation can help creativity and other aspects of well-being in all patients, 
not just artists or researchers.

OBJECTIVES: Neural thread protein (NTP), a membrane-associated phosphoprotein, 
was selectively elevated in the urine of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). 
To demonstrate the potential utility of urine NTP assays for the diagnosis of 
AD, we performed this study.
DESIGN: A prospective blinded multicentered study.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals diagnosed as having probable AD (n = 49), Parkinson's 
disease (PD) (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 22) were enrolled consecutively 
in 4 neurology centers.
MEASUREMENTS: A first morning urine sample was obtained from each subject. Urine 
NTP measurement using competitive ELISA was tested at the central laboratory and 
compared with AD and PD patients and healthy controls (HC). The testing 
laboratory was blinded to clinical information.
RESULTS: The mean assay value in AD (n = 49, 26.8 ± 9.4 μg/mL) was significantly 
higher than in HC (n = 22, 18.1 ± 6.7 μg/mL) (P ≤ .001) and than in PD (n = 20, 
21.0 ± 8.5 μg/mL) (P ≤ .05). Levels of 21.6 μg/mL or higher were found in 81.6% 
of all AD cases, in 30.0% of PD cases, and in 13.6% of HC. Urine NTP assay 
measurements of AD with a Clinical Dementia Rate (CDR) of 0.5 (n = 10, 24.2 ± 
5.9 μg/mL, P = .063) or of 1.0 (n = 24, 30.1 ± 10.9 μg/mL, P = .000) were 
significantly higher than in HC. However, the AD patients with CDR of 2.0 (n = 
9, 23.1 ± 7.3 μg/mL, P = .136) were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Urine NTP could be used as a safe and promising biochemical marker 
of early AD.

Reasons to prescribe antipsychotics for the behavioral symptoms of dementia: a 
survey in Dutch nursing homes among physicians, nurses, and family caregivers.

Cornegé-Blokland E(1), Kleijer BC, Hertogh CM, van Marum RJ.

(1)Geriatric Department, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: Despite serious safety concerns, prescription rates of 
antipsychotics for the treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia remain high, especially in nursing homes. This high prevalence of 
antipsychotic use cannot be explained by the modest success rate reported in the 
literature. In this study, we aim at clarifying the reasons for prescribing an 
antipsychotic drug in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and look 
at the role of nurses and family caregivers in the decision-making process that 
precedes the prescription of an antipsychotic drug.
DESIGN: Questionnaire used in a one-on-one interview with elderly care 
physicians, nurses, and family caregivers.
SETTING: We conducted a survey in 23 nursing homes in the Netherlands.
METHOD: On each dementia ward, the physician selected 1 or 2 patients who 
started antipsychotics most recently. An interviewer then held a structured 
questionnaire with the physician, the nurse, and the first relative of the 
patient. The first part of the interview consisted of questions about the 
general ideas of the physicians and the second part consisted of case-related 
questions to physicians, nurses, and family caregivers.
RESULTS: Physicians, nurses, and family caregivers generally consider the 
possible benefits of antipsychotics to outweigh the risk of side effects. The 
main reasons to start therapy are agitation and aggression. Physicians felt 
pressured by nurses to prescribe in 17% of cases. Physicians felt supported by 
the guideline of the Dutch Association of Elderly Care Physicians. The estimated 
average success rate in the discussed cases (the patient is expected to improve 
on the target behavior) among physicians was 50%, nurses reported 53%, and 
relatives 55%. The most frequently expected adverse reactions were increased 
fall risk, sedation, and parkinsonism. Nurses expected cognitive decline. The 
family felt insufficiently informed about the side effects in 44% of the cases.
CONCLUSION: The interviewed nursing home physicians and nurses expect almost 
half of their patients with dementia and behavioral disturbances to benefit from 
antipsychotic therapy. Serious side effects were expected to occur only 
sporadically. These expectations may contribute to the high rate of 
antipsychotic use among these patients.

Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia in frail older people: a systematic 
literature review.

Author information:
(1)BENECOMO, Flemish-Netherlands Geriatric Oral Research Group, Ghent, 
Belgium/Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the risks for aspiration pneumonia in frail 
older people and the contribution of bad oral health among the risk factors.
DESIGN: Systematic literature review.
SETTING: PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL 
were searched for eligible studies, published in English in the period January 
2000 to April 2009.
PARTICIPANTS: Frail older people.
MEASUREMENTS: Only publications with regard to hospitalized, institutionalized, 
or frail home-dwelling people of 60 years and older were eligible. Two authors 
independently assessed the publications for their methodological quality. 
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals for respective risk factors related to aspiration pneumonia were 
extracted. The results were evaluated according to the levels of evidence of the 
Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine.
RESULTS: A total of 21 publications fulfilled the quality criteria. Evidence 
level 2a (systematic review with homogeneity of cohort studies) was found for a 
positive relationship between aspiration pneumonia and age, male gender, lung 
diseases, dysphagia, and diabetes mellitus; 2b (individual cohort study) for 
severe dementia, angiotensin I-converting enzyme deletion/deletion genotype, and 
bad oral health; 3a (systematic review with homogeneity of case-control studies) 
for malnutrition; 3b (individual case-control study) for Parkinson's disease and 
the use of antipsychotic drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The contribution of bad oral health 
among the risk factors seems limited.
CONCLUSION: Thirteen significant risk factors were identified: age, male gender, 
lung diseases, dysphagia, diabetes mellitus, severe dementia, angiotensin 
I-converting enzyme deletion/deletion genotype, bad oral health, malnutrition, 
Parkinson's disease, and the use of antipsychotic drugs, proton pump inhibitors, 
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The contribution of bad oral 
health seems limited.

AIM: This paper presents findings from secondary analysis of longitudinal data 
on correlates of care relationship mutuality collected from 91 carers of people 
with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in the control group of a 
randomized trial of home-care skill training.
BACKGROUND: Many family members and other informal carers are reported to suffer 
multiple adverse social, financial, psychological and physical caregiving 
outcomes. High levels of mutuality, the perception that the quality of the care 
relationship is positive, reportedly ameliorate these negative outcomes.
METHOD: Multilevel models for change were used to explore whether care recipient 
functional ability, carer gender, depressive symptoms, kin relation to care 
recipient (spouse, non-spouse) and years of caregiving experience were related 
to carers' perceptions of care relationship mutuality over a 12-month period. 
Data collection took place between 2003 and 2008.
RESULTS: Carers who reported lower mutuality: (1) were caring for care 
recipients with lower functional ability, (2) had less caregiving experience and 
(3) had more depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Informal carers who perceive little mutuality in their relationship 
with the care recipient may be more likely to terminate care early. Clinicians 
and researchers should explore the quality of the caregiving relationship as a 
critical factor in carer and care recipient outcomes. Home-care skill training 
may need to include relationship-building skills to offset adverse carer 
outcomes.

Dementia in Parkinson's disease.

Dementia in Parkinson's disease encompasses a spectrum relating to motor, 
psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms that are classified as either Dementia with 
Lewy Bodies (DLB) (initial cognitive symptoms) or Parkinson's Disease Dementia 
(PDD) (initial motor signs preceding cognitive symptoms by at least a year). 
Anticholinergic and antipsychotic drugs have a high risk of adverse cognitive 
and/or motor effects, so their use should be minimized or avoided. Neuroleptic 
sensitivity is a severe psychomotor adverse reaction that is particularly 
associated with potent dopamine-blocking agents such as haloperidol. It occurs 
in up to 50% of individuals with PDD or DLB. Mild psychotic symptoms should 
first be addressed by reducing anticholinergic and/or dopaminergic agents, if 
possible. Patients with psychotic symptoms that threaten the safety of the 
patient or caregiver may benefit from treatment with quetiapine or, in 
refractory cases, clozapine. Cholinesterase inhibitors as a drug class have been 
shown to have beneficial effects on cognition in DLB and PDD, and may help to 
alleviate some psychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, anxiety, hallucinations, 
and delusions. Memantine may help to moderate cognitive symptoms in DLB and PDD, 
although current data suggest a more variable response, particularly in PDD. 
Parkinsonian motor signs that are accompanied by clinically significant 
cognitive impairment should be treated with carbidopa/levodopa only, as dopamine 
agonists and other antiparkinsonian medications generally carry a higher risk of 
provoking or exacerbating psychotic symptoms. Excessive daytime sleepiness and 
REM sleep behavior disorder are common associated features of PDD and DLB. 
Minimizing sedating medications during the day and promoting nocturnal sleep may 
help the daytime sleepiness; melatonin, clonazepam, gabapentin, and possibly 
memantine may be useful in treating REM sleep behavior disorder. Orthostatic 
hypotension can be managed with various nonpharmacologic interventions, and if 
needed, fludrocortisone and pyridostigmine. Midodrine should be used cautiously, 
if at all.

Neuropsychological functioning in Parkinson's disease: differential 
relationships with self-reported sleep-wake disturbances.

Research Institute, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance may represent a risk factor for the development of 
dementia in Parkinson's disease. However, prior studies exploring the 
association between specific sleep-wake disturbances and neuropsychological 
functions have been limited.
METHODS: In this study, 101 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were 
assessed neurologically, underwent neuropsychological testing, and completed 
self-report questionnaires covering nocturnal disturbance, excessive daytime 
sleepiness, and symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
RESULTS: Univariate correlations revealed differential patterns of 
neuropsychological performance in relation to nocturnal sleep disturbance, 
excessive daytime sleepiness, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. 
After controlling for potential confounders, excessive daytime sleepiness 
remained a significant predictor of slowed processing speed, and rapid eye 
movement sleep behavior disorder predicted working memory and verbal fluency 
performance. The relationships between nocturnal sleep disturbance and memory 
appeared to be mediated by education.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the critical role that specific sleep-wake 
disturbances in Parkinson's disease might have on neuropsychological 
functioning, which may reflect common neural underpinnings. © 2011 Movement

Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene elevate the risk of Parkinson 
disease and dementia with Lewy bodies; both disorders are characterized by 
misprocessing of α-synuclein (SNCA). A loss in lysosomal acid-β-glucosidase 
enzyme (GCase) activity due to biallelic GBA1 mutations underlies Gaucher 
disease. We explored mechanisms for the gene's association with increased 
synucleinopathy risk.
METHODS: We analyzed the effects of wild-type (WT) and several GBA mutants on 
SNCA in cellular and in vivo models using biochemical and immunohistochemical 
protocols.
RESULTS: We observed that overexpression of all GBA mutants examined (N370S, 
L444P, D409H, D409V, E235A, and E340A) significantly raised human SNCA levels to 
121 to 248% of vector control (p < 0.029) in neural MES23.5 and PC12 cells, but 
without altering GCase activity. Overexpression of WT GBA in neural and 
HEK293-SNCA cells increased GCase activity, as expected (ie, to 167% in 
MES-SNCA, 128% in PC12-SNCA, and 233% in HEK293-SNCA; p < 0.002), but had mixed 
effects on SNCA. Nevertheless, in HEK293-SNCA cells high GCase activity was 
associated with SNCA reduction by ≤32% (p = 0.009). Inhibition of cellular GCase 
activity (to 8-20% of WT; p < 0.0017) did not detectably alter SNCA levels. 
Mutant GBA-induced SNCA accumulation could be pharmacologically reversed in 
D409V-expressing PC12-SNCA cells by rapamycin, an autophagy-inducer (≤40%; 10μM; 
p < 0.02). Isofagomine, a GBA chaperone, showed a related trend. In mice 
expressing two D409Vgba knockin alleles without signs of Gaucher disease 
(residual GCase activity, ≥20%), we recorded an age-dependent rise of endogenous 
Snca in hippocampal membranes (125% vs WT at 52 weeks; p = 0.019). In young 
Gaucher disease mice (V394Lgba+/+//prosaposin[ps]-null//ps-transgene), which 
demonstrate neurological dysfunction after age 10 weeks (GCase activity, ≤10%), 
we recorded no significant change in endogenous Snca levels at 12 weeks of age. 
However, enhanced neuronal ubiquitin signals and axonal spheroid formation were 
already present. The latter changes were similar to those seen in three week-old 
cathepsin D-deficient mice.
INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that GBA mutants promote SNCA 
accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, thereby identifying a 
biochemical link between GBA1 mutation carrier status and increased 
synucleinopathy risk. In cell culture models, this gain of toxic function effect 
can be mitigated by rapamycin. Loss in GCase activity did not immediately raise 
SNCA concentrations, but first led to neuronal ubiquitinopathy and axonal 
spheroids, a phenotype shared with other lysosomal storage disorders.

A précis of recent advances in the neuropsychology of mild cognitive 
impairment(s) in Parkinson's disease and a proposal of preliminary research 
criteria.

Cognitive changes of Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest earlier and are more 
heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Approximately one-third of patients 
have at least mild cognitive changes at PD diagnosis, and subtle changes might 
be appreciable among those at risk for PD. Executive dysfunction is the most 
common cognitive change, but other phenotypes exist. Pathobiologic and potential 
prognostic differences among cognitive phenotypes remain poorly understood. 
Progress in the neuropsychology, epidemiology and pathobiology of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) in PD is hampered by lack of diagnostic criteria. This study 
proposes preliminary research criteria for two categories of PD non-dementia 
cognitive impairment.

Sleep disturbance in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: a 
multicenter analysis.

Health Center, 1841 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. dbliwis@emory.edu

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Evidence suggests that patients with dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) may have more nocturnal sleep disturbance than patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). We sought to confirm such observations using a large, 
prospectively collected, standardized, multicenter-derived database, i.e. the 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.
METHODS: Nocturnal sleep disturbance (NSD) data, as characterized by the 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), were derived from 4,531 
patients collected between September 2005 and November 2008 from 32 National 
Institute on Aging participating AD centers. Patient and informant 
characteristics were compared between those with and without NSD by dementia 
diagnosis (DLB and probable AD). Finally, a logistic regression model was 
created to quantify the association between NSD status and diagnosis while 
adjusting for these patient/informant characteristics, as well as center.
RESULTS: NSD was more frequent in clinically diagnosed DLB relative to 
clinically diagnosed AD (odds ratio = 2.93, 95% confidence interval = 
2.22-3.86). These results were independent from the gender of the patient or 
informant, whether the informant lived with the patient, and other patient 
characteristics, such as dementia severity, depressive symptoms, and 
NPI-Q-derived measures of hallucinations, delusions, agitation and apathy. In 
AD, but not DLB, patients, NSD was associated with more advanced disease. 
Comorbidity of NSD with hallucinations, agitation and apathy was higher in DLB 
than in AD. There was also evidence that the percentage of DLB cases with NSD 
showed wide variation across centers.
CONCLUSION: As defined by the NPI-Q, endorsement of the nocturnal behavior item 
by informants is more likely in patients with DLB when compared to AD, even 
after the adjustment of key patient/informant characteristics.

Striatal β-amyloid in dementia with Lewy bodies but not Parkinson's disease.

Professor Jellinger first identified that striatal Aβ deposition at postmortem 
seemed to differentiate cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from those with 
Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), a finding subsequently questioned. Our 
replication study in 34 prospectively studied cases assessed the ability of 
striatal Aβ deposition to differentiate DLB from PDD, and also assessed the 
relationship between striatal and cortical Aβ deposition and 
α-synuclein-immunoreactive pathologies, using previously published protocols. 
Cases with DLB had significantly shorter durations and greater dementia 
severities compared with cases with PDD. Striatal Aβ-immunoreactive plaques were 
only consistently found in cases with DLB and correlated with both the severity 
(positive correlation) and duration (negative correlation) of dementia. Striatal 
Aβ-immunoreactive plaques also positively correlated with the severity of 
α-synuclein-immunoreactive pathologies as well as cortical Aβ-positive plaques. 
Striatal Aβ deposition positively predicted dementia in Lewy body cases with 
high specificity and had the greatest sensitivity to differentiate DLB from PDD 
with 100% negative predictive value. These data suggest that striatal Aβ 
deposition in Lewy body diseases contributes to early dementia and in these 
cases may impact on the efficacy of treatments targeting the striatum.

Making an accurate diagnosis of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD-D) patients 
is a challenge that neurologists will have to face in the coming years. In 2007, 
a Task force of the Movement Disorders Society proposed operational diagnostic 
criteria for the diagnosis of PD-D, consisting of step I and step II. We 
assessed the validity of step I with reference to the diagnosis made after a 
formal neuropsychological evaluation and by applying the current gold standard 
for the diagnosis of PD-D (DSM IV). Step I had a sensitivity of 78% and a 
specificity of 95.5%. Step I displayed a positive predictive value of 70%, a 
negative predictive value of 97%, and an accuracy of 93.4%. The clinimetric 
properties observed in our setting suggest that step I may be considered as a 
good screening tool (negative predictive value of 97%); however, using step I 
alone to make a diagnosis of PD-D may lead to an overestimation of dementia in 
PD, particularly in patients with considerable dysexecutive deficits (positive 
predictive value of 70%). In conclusion, formal neuropsychology and longitudinal 
follow-up are still required for the diagnosis and categorization of dementia in 
PD.

Insomnia in central neurologic diseases--occurrence and management.

Mayer G(1), Jennum P, Riemann D, Dauvilliers Y.

Author information:
(1)Hephata Klinik, Schwalmstadt-Treysa, Germany. geert.mayer@hephata.com

The objective of this review is to highlight the impact of insomnia in central 
neurological disorders by providing information on its prevalence and give 
recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Insomnia in neurological disorders 
is a frequent, but underestimated symptom. Its occurrence may be a direct 
consequence of the disease itself or may be secondary to pain, depression, other 
sleep disorders or the effects of medications. Insomnia can have a significant 
impact on the patient's cognitive and physical function and may be associated 
with psychological distress and depression. Diagnosis of insomnia is primarily 
based on medical history and validated questionnaires. Actigraphy is a helpful 
diagnostic tool for assessing the circadian sleep-wake rhythm. For differential 
diagnosis and to measure the duration of sleep full polysomnography may be 
recommended. Prior to initiating treatment the cause of insomnia must be clearly 
identified. First line treatment aims at the underlying neurologic disease. The 
few high quality treatment studies show that short term treatment with hypnotics 
may be recommended in most disorders after having ruled out high risk for 
adverse effects. Sedating antidepressants may be an effective treatment for 
insomnia in stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Melatonin and light 
treatment can stabilize the sleep-wake circadian rhythm and shorten sleep 
latency in dementias and PD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective 
in treating insomnia symptoms associated with most of the central neurological 
diseases. The prevalence and treatment of insomnia in neurological diseases 
still need to be studied in larger patient groups with randomized clinical 
trials to a) better understand their impact and causal relationship and b) to 
develop and improve specific evidence-based treatment strategies.

[Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accompanied by symptoms of late catatonia: what 
to consider and how to treat].

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has recently often been reported to exhibit 
various psychiatric symptoms. However, some DLB patients do not present typical 
clinical courses or psychiatric symptoms. We report two DLB patients with 
characteristic psychiatric symptoms: a depressive state and anxiety in the early 
stage, and auditory hallucination, delusion of guilt, and catatonia in the later 
stage. Pharmacotherapy was ineffective, but electroconvulsive therapy proved to 
have a marked effect. The clinical course represents the symptomatic concept of 
"late catatonia," which Sommer first reported in 1910 and Kocha later 
reappraised. In Japan, this has been prevailing as a useful concept in the field 
of clinical geriatric psychiatry. We discuss what to consider and how to treat 
DLB patients including those with atypical courses and psychiatric symptoms. We 
consider and treated them as "late catatonia", with a favorable response to 
treatment. There is an important viewpoint which helps us understand the 
process. The viewpoint is to distinguish between "genera" and "types" of mental 
illnesses as inherited from classical psychopathology to modern psychiatry. DLB 
corresponds to "genera" and late catatonia to "types." In treating DLB patients 
with atypical symptoms and courses, it appears clinically very important to 
think more about late catatonia, exhibiting characteristic symptoms. This also 
reveals the usefulness of understanding and treating such cases based on the 
concept of "genera" and "types." <Authors' abstract>

Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.

Hospital, Stavanger, Norway. daarsland@gmail.com

Prospective studies conducted during the last decade have shown that the 
majority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop dementia. In 
addition, using a variety of definitions and methods, more recent research 
suggests that approximately a quarter of PD patients without dementia have mild 
cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Furthermore, several studies have shown that 
approximately 20% have MCI even at time of diagnosis of PD. The typical 
cognitive deficits include visuospatial, attentional, and executive deficits, 
but memory deficits have also been shown. The etiology of PD-MCI is not known, 
but it is likely that mechanisms known to contribute to dementia in PD (ie, 
limbic and cortical Lewy bodies, amyloid plaques, and cholinergic deficits) play 
a role, in addition to dysfunction of dopaminergic frontostriatal circuits. 
PD-MCI predicts a shorter time to dementia, and preliminary evidence suggests 
that this is particularly true for posterior cognitive deficits. There are 
currently no systematic clinical trials in PD-MCI.

Mild cognitive impairment and cognitive reserve in Parkinson's disease.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically present with motor symptoms, 
but non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction 
and neuropsychiatric symptoms, are usually also present, when looked for 
carefully. The objective of this paper is to provide an up-to-date, 
comprehensive review of two undecided issues about cognitive impairment in PD 
patients without dementia: the concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 
the concept of Cognitive Reserve (CR). Empirical findings support the value of 
the concept of MCI in this population, from the early untreated stages onwards. 
Further studies are needed to establish 1) the clinical-neuroimaging 
characteristics of MCI subtypes in PD, in comparison to those MCI subtypes in 
patients without PD; 2) whether different types of MCI in PD are associated with 
different rates of cognitive decline during the progression of the disease. 
Preliminary empirical evidence also shows that education might exert a 
protective effect on cognitive decline in PD and that less educated subjects are 
at increased risk for developing dementia, lending support to the CR hypothesis, 
in this population as well. Further studies are necessary to investigate how CR 
modulates cognitive decline in PD and other frontal-subcortical disorders, e.g., 
by identifying possible differential effects of CR on different cognitive 
domains.

Tauopathies are characterized by hyperphosphorylation of the 
microtubule-associated protein tau and its accumulation into fibrillar 
aggregates. Toxic effects of aggregated tau and/or dysfunction of soluble tau 
could both contribute to neural defects in these neurodegenerative diseases. We 
have generated a novel knockin mouse model of an inherited tauopathy, 
frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to tau mutations on chromosome 
17 (FTDP-17T). We incorporated a single mutation, homologous to the common 
FTDP-17T P301L mutation, directly into the endogenous mouse gene, mimicking the 
human disease situation. These mice express P301L-equivalent mutant tau at 
normal physiological levels from the knockin allele. Importantly, in contrast to 
existing transgenic mouse models that overexpress human P301L mutant tau, no 
overt tau pathology developed during the normal lifespan of the knockin mice. In 
fact, overall phosphorylation of tau was reduced, perhaps due to reduced 
microtubule binding. However, homozygous knockin mice did display intriguing 
age-dependent changes in axonal transport of mitochondria, and increased 
spontaneous locomotor activity in old age. These could represent early 
consequences of the tau dysfunction that eventually precipitates pathogenesis in 
humans.

In the past 5 years, several leading groups have attempted to explain why 
individuals with Down's syndrome have a reduced risk of many solid tumours and 
an increased risk of leukaemia and testicular cancer. Niels Bohr, the Danish 
physicist, noted that a paradox could initiate progress. We think that the 
paradox of a medical disorder protecting against cancer could be formalised in a 
new model of inverse cancer morbidity in people with other serious diseases. In 
this Personal View, we review evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies 
that supports a consistently lower than expected occurrence of cancer in 
patients with Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, diabetes, 
Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and anorexia nervosa. Intriguingly, 
most comorbidities are neuropsychiatric or CNS disorders. We provide a brief 
overview of evidence indicating genetic and molecular connections between cancer 
and these complex diseases. Inverse comorbidity could be a valuable model to 
investigate common or related pathways or processes and test new therapies, but, 
most importantly, to understand why certain people are protected from the 
malignancy.

Combinations of motor measures more strongly predict adverse health outcomes in 
old age: the rush memory and aging project, a community-based cohort study.

OBJECTIVE: Motor impairment in old age is a growing public-health concern, and 
several different constructs have been used to identify motor impairments in 
older people. We tested the hypothesis that combinations of motor constructs 
more strongly predict adverse health outcomes in older people.
METHODS: In total, 949 people without dementia, history of stroke or Parkinson's 
disease, who were participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (a 
longitudinal community-based cohort study), underwent assessment at study entry. 
From this, three constructs were derived: 1) physical frailty based on grip 
strength, timed walk, body mass index and fatigue; 2) Parkinsonian Signs Score 
based on the modified motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating 
Scale; and 3) a motor construct, based on nine strength measures and nine motor 
performances. Disability and cognitive status were assessed annually. A series 
of Cox proportional-hazards models, controlling for age, sex and education, were 
used to examine the association of each of these three constructs alone and in 
various combinations with death, disability and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
RESULTS: All three constructs were related (mean r = 0.50, all P < 0.001), and 
when considered individually in separate proportional-hazards models, were 
associated with risk of death, incident disability and AD. However, when 
considered together, combinations of these constructs more strongly predicted 
adverse health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical frailty, parkinsonian signs score and global motor score 
are related constructs that capture different aspects of motor function. 
Assessments using several motor constructs may more accurately identify people 
at the highest risk of adverse health consequences in old age.

BACKGROUND: Imaging techniques like ß-CIT Scan are valuable diagnostic tools for 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlate in most cases with clinical symptoms. In 
some patients, however, clinical and imaging data are conflicting. It has not 
yet been evaluated, which parameter provide more information about severity and 
disease progression in those patients.
AIM: To estimate the predictive value of UPDRS and ß-CIT in PD on clinical 
impairment at follow up.
DESIGN AND METHODS: In a longitudinal study, 44 PD patients who underwent ß-CIT 
Scan for diagnostic purpose were followed up for a mean of 44 months. At 
baseline we assessed UPDRS motor score as well as the subtype of PD, presence of 
dementia or motor complications. Disease staging at follow up was displayed by 
UPDRS II (ADL) and III (motor score) as well as by Hoehn & Yahr classification.
RESULTS: ß-CIT could significantly discriminate PD patients from controls and 
the tracer uptake ratios (UR) correlated well with UPDRS motor score at 
baseline. There was, however, only a weak correlation between UR and staging 
parameters at follow up, whereas UPDRS at baseline was highly correlated with 
impairment at follow up.
CONCLUSION: The data suggest a more significant predictive value of UPDRS motor 
score on disability in the course of disease progression than ß-CIT Scan. Low 
receptor binding may not be mistaken for a bad prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: Most people with Parkinson disease (PD) eventually develop cognitive 
impairment (CI). However, neither the timing of onset nor the severity of 
cognitive symptoms can be accurately predicted. We sought plasma-based 
biomarkers for CI in PD.
METHODS: A discovery cohort of 70 PD patients was recruited. Cognitive status 
was evaluated with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS) at baseline and on 
annual follow-up visits, and baseline plasma levels of 102 proteins were 
determined with a bead-based immunoassay. Using linear regression, we identified 
biomarkers of CI in PD, that is, proteins whose levels correlated with cognitive 
performance at baseline and/or cognitive decline at follow-up. We then 
replicated the association between cognitive performance and levels of the top 
biomarker, using a different technical platform, with a separate cohort of 113 
PD patients.
RESULTS: Eleven proteins exhibited plasma levels correlating with baseline 
cognitive performance in the discovery cohort. The best candidate was epidermal 
growth factor (EGF, p < 0.001); many of the other 10 analytes covaried with EGF 
across samples. Low levels of EGF not only correlated with poor cognitive test 
scores at baseline, but also predicted an 8-fold greater risk of cognitive 
decline to dementia-range DRS scores at follow-up for those with intact baseline 
cognition. A weaker, but still significant, relationship between plasma EGF 
levels and cognitive performance was found in an independent replication cohort 
of 113 PD patients.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that plasma EGF may be a biomarker for 
progression to CI in PD.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently accompanied by dementia or 
depression which can aggravate the clinical picture of the disease and increase 
the risk of care dependency (CD). Little is known about the associations between 
PD, these neuropsychiatric comorbidities and CD in outpatients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A nationwide sample of outpatients (n=1,449) was examined 
by office-based neurologists (n=315) comprising the documentation of the 
general, neurological status and the degree of CD. The dementia status was 
clinically rated according to the established DSM-IV criteria. Depression was 
screened with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
RESULTS: Overall, 18.3% of all patients were care dependent. Even after 
adjustment for PD severity, patients with depression (OR=2.8; 95% CI 1.8-4.3), 
dementia (OR=2.7; 95% CI 1.8-4.1) or both (OR=3.9; 95% CI 2.5-60,0) were at 
higher risk for CD than patients without dementia or depression. Patients aged 
≥76 years were fourfold more likely to be care dependent than patients aged ≤65 
years (OR=3.5; 95% CI 2.3-5.5). Across all age groups, patients with depression 
featured the highest increments (from 11.9 to 42.0%).
CONCLUSION: The risk for CD is substantially elevated in outpatients with PD 
when further neuropsychiatric symptoms are present. The data suggest that 
depression contributes equally to disability as does dementia.

The ALS/PDC syndrome of Guam: potential biomarkers for an enigmatic disorder.

Vancouver, BC, Canada. mcgeerpl@interchange.ubc.ca

The ALS/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam is a long latency disease with a 
diverse phenotypic expression characteristic of classical ALS, parkinsonism and 
dementia. It is remarkably similar to a syndrome localized to the Kii Peninsula 
of Japan. There are as yet no identified pathological features that will clearly 
distinguish the Guam or Kii ALS/PDC syndrome from other degenerative 
neurological disorders. At present, ALS/PDC of Guam and the Kii Peninsula can be 
confirmed only by postmortem examination. The most prominent pathological 
hallmark is the widespread occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles which express 
the same balance of 3R and 4R tau that is found in Alzheimer disease. They both 
show an increased prevalence of a peculiar retinal disorder termed linear 
retinal pigmentary epitheliopathy. The disorders are both highly familial. 
Several environmental factors have been proposed but no supportive evidence for 
an environmental or dietary factor has been found. Genome searches have so far 
failed to identify causative genes although two single nuclear polymorphisms 
related to MAPT that increase the risk of the Guam syndrome have been located. 
The two syndromes are clearly unique, and clues as to their causation could be 
beneficial in understanding the etiology of similar, but much more prevalent 
disorders in North America, Europe and Asia. Identification of biomarkers for 
premortem diagnosis would be helpful in management as well as in revealing the 
true etiology.

Autonomic dysfunction in PD: a window to early detection?

Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1620,

It has been suggested that autonomic dysfunction constitutes a biomarker for 
early detection of the disease process in Parkinson disease (PD). Recent 
findings based on cardiac sympathetic and striatal dopaminergic imaging in the 
same patients indicate that this view is overly simple. Although evidence of 
cardiac sympathetic denervation is associated with other non-motor 
manifestations such as anosmia, REM behavior disorder, dementia, baroreflex 
failure, and orthostatic hypotension (OH), across individual patients the 
severities of OH and of the cardiac sympathetic lesion (indicated by thoracic 
6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine PET scanning) are unrelated to the severity of the 
putamen dopaminergic lesion (indicated by brain 6-[(18)F]fluorodopa PET 
scanning). Moreover, whereas cases have been reported with neuroimaging evidence 
of cardiac sympathetic denervation several years before motor onset of PD, in 
other cases loss of cardiac sympathetic innervation progresses approximately 
concurrently with the movement disorder or can even occur as a late finding. 
Bases for independent sympathetic noradrenergic and striatal dopaminergic 
lesions in Lewy body diseases remain poorly understood. In elderly patients with 
unexplained OH or other evidence of autonomic failure, it is reasonable for 
clinicians to look for subtle signs of parkinsonism, such as masked facies, 
cogwheel rigidity, and shuffling gate.

BACKGROUND: We investigated to what extent cognitive impairment and dementia 
were related to the direct medical and nonmedical costs in Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Sixty-one patients with Parkinson's disease from a population-based 
cohort were assessed for motor and cognitive symptoms in 1993, 1997, and 2001. 
Data on use of health care and social services were collected.
RESULTS: The costs of patients with dementia were 3.3 times higher (€34,980) 
than those of nondemented patients (€10,626) per year of survival. Institutional 
care was the largest cost factor, representing 67% of the costs. Cognitive 
functioning predicted direct costs by 29.4%. Cognitive decline was associated 
with increased costs, even in nondemented subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that dementia has a substantial impact on 
direct costs in Parkinson's disease, mainly due to high costs for institutional 
care. In addition, there were indications that even patients with mild cognitive 
impairment have higher nonmedical costs.

Factors contributing to institutionalization in patients with Huntington's 
disease.

The objective of this study was to determine which factors are predictive of 
institutionalization in Huntington's disease. Seven hundred and ninety-nine 
subjects with 4313 examinations from the Baltimore Huntington's Disease Center 
were included in the data set; 88 of these patients with an average follow-up 
time of 9.2 years went from living at home to being institutionalized while 
being observed in our clinic. We examined demographic, genetic, and clinical 
variables for a relationship with institutionalization using linear regressions, 
a Cox proportional hazards model, and χ2 or t tests in certain cases. In our 
linear models, scores on the Quantified Neurologic Examination (R2=0.203, 
P<.001), Huntington's disease Activities of Daily Living Scale (R2=0.259, 
P<.001), and Motor Impairment Score (R2=0.173, P<.001) were found to have the 
strongest correlation with time until institutionalization. In addition, CAG 
repeat length (R2=0.248, P<.001) was significantly associated with disease 
duration at institutionalization, when controlling for age at onset. In the Cox 
proportional hazards model, scores on the Activities of Daily Living Scale, 
Mini-Mental State Examination, Quantified Neurologic Examination, and Motor 
Impairment Score all significantly predicted placement in long-term care. 
Finally, institutionalized patients were shown to have a higher CAG number and a 
lower level of educational attainment than patients who avoided 
institutionalization for at least 15 years after disease onset. Neurologic 
findings, functional capacity, cognitive impairment, and CAG repeat length are 
all likely determinants of institutionalization. In contrast with other 
dementing conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, psychiatric symptoms were 
not shown to predict institutionalization in Huntington's disease. This may 
illustrate the especially debilitating nature of the movement disorder of 
Huntington's disease in comparison with the other dementias.

Neuropsychiatric disorders are becoming a major socioeconomic burden to modern 
society. In recent years, a dramatic expansion of tools has facilitated the 
study of the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Molecular imaging 
has enabled the noninvasive characterization and quantification of biological 
processes at the cellular, tissue, and organism levels in intact living 
subjects. This technology has revolutionized the practice of medicine and has 
become critical to quality health care. New advances in research on molecular 
imaging hold promise for personalized medicine in neuropsychiatric disorders, 
with adjusted therapeutic doses, predictable responses, reduced adverse drug 
reactions, early diagnosis, and personal health planning. In this paper, we 
discuss the development of radiotracers for imaging dopaminergic, serotonergic, 
and noradrenergic systems and β-amyloid plaques. We will underline the role of 
molecular imaging technologies in various neuropsychiatric disorders, describe 
their unique strengths and limitations, and suggest future directions in the 
diagnosis and management of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Potential early markers of neurodegeneration such as subtle motor signs, reduced 
color discrimination, olfactory impairment, and brain perfusion abnormalities 
have been reported in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a 
risk factor for Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. The aim of this 
study was to reproduce observations of regional cerebral blood flow 
abnormalities in a larger independent sample of patients and to explore 
correlations between regional cerebral blood flow and markers of 
neurodegeneration. Twenty patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep 
behavior disorder and 20 healthy controls were studied by single-photon emission 
computerized tomography. Motor examination, color discrimination, and olfactory 
identification were examined. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
disorder showed decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex and 
in medial parietal areas and increased regional cerebral blood flow in 
subcortical regions including the bilateral pons, putamen, and hippocampus. In 
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, brain perfusion in the frontal 
cortex and occipital areas was associated with poorer performance in the color 
discrimination test. Moreover, a relationship between loss of olfactory 
discrimination and regional cerebral blood flow reduction in the bilateral 
anterior parahippocampal gyrus, a region known to be involved in olfactory 
functions, was found. This study provides further evidence of regional cerebral 
blood flow abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder that are 
similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Moreover, 
regional cerebral blood flow anomalies were associated with markers of 
neurodegeneration.

The SCOPA-Cognition is a reliable and valid test to evaluate cognitive 
functioning in Parkinson's disease and is widely used in clinical and research 
settings. Recently, the Movement Disorder Society introduced criteria for 
Parkinson's disease dementia. The objective of the present study was to use 
these criteria to determine SCOPA-Cognition cutoffs for maximum accuracy, 
screening, and diagnosing of Parkinson's disease dementia. A total of 282 
patients with Parkinson's disease were assessed with the SCOPA-Cognition and the 
Movement Disorder Society's Parkinson's disease dementia criteria. From the 275 
patients with a complete assessment of the dementia criteria, 12% (n = 32) 
fulfilled the criteria. Data from 268 patients with complete assessments of both 
the dementia criteria and the SCOPA-Cognition were used to determine cutoffs for 
maximum accuracy, screening, and diagnosing of Parkinson's disease dementia. The 
area under the curve was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97), showing a 
strong association between the dementia criteria and the SCOPA-Cognition. The 
cutoff for maximum accuracy was 22/23, based on the highest sum of sensitivity 
(0.80) and specificity (0.87), with positive and negative predictive values of 
0.43 and 0.97, respectively. The optimal screening cutoff was 24/25, and the 
optimal diagnostic cutoff was 17/18. Using the recently published Parkinson's 
disease dementia criteria as a reference, the current study presents 
SCOPA-Cognition cutoffs for maximum accuracy, screening, and diagnosing of 
Parkinson's disease dementia. The availability of SCOPA-Cognition cutoffs for 
Parkinson's disease dementia may contribute to the scale's usefulness and 
promote its further use in both clinical and research settings.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with multiple morbidities and polypharmacy are at 
an increased risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). Appropriate prescribing, 
preserving the balance between drug effectiveness and safety, and treatment 
adherence may prevent these ADEs. In this study, we investigated which drug 
properties, such as effectiveness, safety, clinical experience and convenience, 
are relevant to the choice of medicine most appropriate for frail elderly 
patients.
OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to develop a set of criteria to 
assist in the selection of the most appropriate drug within a drug class for the 
treatment of frail elderly patients. A secondary goal was to test the usefulness 
of the set of criteria in the prescription of antipsychotics for delirium and 
behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
METHODS: Thirty-one criteria potentially relevant to the choice of appropriate 
drugs for frail elderly patients were selected on the basis of a literature 
search in MEDLINE (1966-2008), EMBASE (1947-2008) and the Cochrane Library 
(1993-2008). This list was reviewed by 46 experts (24 physicians, 22 
pharmacists), who scored each item for relevance in clinical practice on a scale 
from 1 to 10 (where 1 is not important and 10 is very important). By consensus, 
the authors selected the most relevant criteria for the final set of criteria. 
The usefulness of the final set of criteria was assessed with regard to the 
prescription of antipsychotics for delirium and BPSD.
RESULTS: The final set of 23 items consisted of 3 items on effectiveness, 14 on 
safety, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic criteria, 3 on clinical 
experience and 3 on convenience. Assessment using these criteria of the 
appropriateness of antipsychotics prescribed for delirium and BPSD revealed that 
certain drugs should be prescribed with caution to patients with Parkinson's 
disease and Lewy body dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria identified in this study, selected on the basis of a 
literature review and clinical expert opinion, represent a promising approach 
for determining the appropriateness of a drug for use in frail elderly 
individuals relative to alternative drugs for the same indication or from the 
same class.

DNA methylation in neurodegenerative disorders: a missing link between genome 
and environment?

The risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease 
or Parkinson's disease is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. 
Environmental events occurring during development or later in life can be 
related to disease susceptibility. One way by which the environment may exert 
its effect is through epigenetic modifications, which might affect the 
functioning of genes. These include nucleosome positioning, post-translational 
histone modifications, and DNA methylation. In this review we will focus in the 
potential role of DNA methylation in neurodegenerative disorders and in the 
approaches to explore such epigenetic changes. Advances in deciphering the role 
of epigenetic modifications in phenotype are being uncovered for a variety of 
diseases, including cancer, autoimmune, neurodevelopmental and cognitive 
disorders. Epigenetic modifications are now being also associated with 
cardiovascular and metabolic traits, and they are expected to be especially 
involved in learning and memory processes, as well as in neurodegenerative 
disease. The study of the role of methylation and other epigenetic modifications 
in disease development will provide new insights in the etiopathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative disorders, and should hopefully shape new avenues in the 
development of therapeutic strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Neuronal loss in the locus coeruleus (LC) is common in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia 
(PDD). The aims of the present study were to investigate LC degeneration in 
different dementia disorders including vascular dementia (VaD) and 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), to compare LC degeneration with 
severity of pathology in AD and DLB/PDD, to further evaluate the usefulness of a 
previously presented scoring system and to examine the predictive value of 
macroscopic assessment of the LC.
METHODS: A horizontal mid-level section of the pons was examined in 200 
neuropathologically examined cases with clinical dementia. A previous 
macroscopic assessment of the LC was performed in 149 of the cases.
RESULTS: Cases with DLB/ PDD and AD presented with the highest microscopic LC 
degeneration scores, with significant differences compared to combined AD + VaD, 
in turn with a higher score than VaD, FTLD and other dementia disorders. 
Interrater agreement (weighted kappa;) for LC degeneration scoring was 0.83 - 
0.91. DLB/ PDD, AD and AD + VaD were the diagnoses for 85% of the cases with 
macroscopic LC depigmentation.
CONCLUSION: LC degeneration, which may be macroscopically noted, often indicates 
synuclein and/or Alzheimer pathology among demented. When clinical information 
is scarce or inconsistent, a macroscopic assessment of the LC may facilitate 
focusing of the subsequent neuropathological investigation. Also, the 
semiquantitative scoring system is a reliable tool for histological assessment 
of LC degeneration.

BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has been reported to be a risk 
factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). 
Previous neuropathological studies have demonstrated similar frequencies of the 
APOE ε4 allele in AD and DLB. However, the few ante-mortem studies on APOE 
allele frequencies in DLB have shown lower frequencies than post-mortem studies. 
One reason for this may be inaccuracy of diagnosis. We examined APOE genotypes 
in subjects with AD, DLB, and a control group using the latest diagnostic 
criteria and MRI, SPECT, and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy.
METHODS: The subjects of this study consisted of 145 patients with probable AD, 
50 subjects with probable DLB, and a control group. AD subjects were divided 
into two groups based on age of onset: early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD 
(LOAD). All subjects had characteristic features on MRI, SPECT, and/or 
myocardial scintigraphy.
RESULTS: The rate of APOE4 carrier status was 18.3% and the frequency of the ε4 
allele was 9.7% in controls. The rate of APOE4 carrier status and the frequency 
of the ε4 allele were 47% and 27% for LOAD, 50% and 31% for EOAD, and 42% and 
31% for DLB, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The APOE4 genotypes in this study are consistent with previous 
neuropathological studies suggesting accurate diagnosis of AD and DLB. APOE4 
genotypes were similar in AD and DLB, giving further evidence that the ε4 allele 
is a risk factor for both disorders.

Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent and early feature of patients with 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and is very uncommon in patients with frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD). Mechanisms underlying this clinical manifestation are poorly understood 
but the premature deposition of protein aggregates in the olfactory bulb (OB) of 
these patients might impair its synaptic organization, thus accounting for the 
smell deficits. Tau, β-amyloid and alpha-synuclein deposits were studied in 41 
human OBs with histological diagnosis of AD (n = 24), PD (n = 6), FTD (n = 11) 
and compared with the OB of 15 control subjects. Tau pathology was present in 
the OB of all patients, irrespective of the histological diagnosis, while 
β-amyloid and alpha-synuclein protein deposit were frequently observed in AD and 
PD, respectively. Using stereological techniques we found an increased number of 
dopaminergic periglomerular neurons in the OB of AD, PD and FTD patients when 
compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, volumetric measurements of OBs 
showed a significant decrease only in AD patients, while the OB volume was 
similar to control in PD or FTD cases. The increased dopaminergic tone created 
in the OBs of these patients could reflect a compensatory mechanism created by 
the early degeneration of other neurotransmitter systems and might contribute to 
the olfactory dysfunction exhibited by patients with neurodegenerative 
disorders.

We assessed the relationship between consensus clinical diagnostic 
classification and neurochemical positron emission tomography imaging of 
striatal vesicular monoamine transporters and cerebrocortical deposition of 
aβ-amyloid in mild dementia. Seventy-five subjects with mild dementia 
(Mini-Mental State Examination score≥18) underwent a conventional clinical 
evaluation followed by 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine positron emission tomography 
imaging of striatal vesicular monoamine transporters and 11C-Pittsburgh 
compound-B positron emission tomography imaging of cerebrocortical aβ-amyloid 
deposition. Clinical classifications were assigned by consensus of an 
experienced clinician panel. Neuroimaging classifications were assigned as 
Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies on the 
basis of the combined 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine and 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B 
results. Thirty-six subjects were classified clinically as having Alzheimer's 
disease, 25 as having frontotemporal dementia and 14 as having dementia with 
Lewy bodies. Forty-seven subjects were classified by positron emission 
tomography neuroimaging as having Alzheimer's disease, 15 as having dementia 
with Lewy bodies and 13 as having frontotemporal dementia. There was only 
moderate agreement between clinical consensus and neuroimaging classifications 
across all dementia subtypes, with discordant classifications in ∼35% of 
subjects (Cohen's κ=0.39). Discordant classifications were least frequent in 
clinical consensus Alzheimer's disease (17%), followed by dementia with Lewy 
bodies (29%) and were most common in frontotemporal dementia (64%). Accurate 
clinical classification of mild neurodegenerative dementia is challenging. 
Though additional post-mortem correlations are required, positron emission 
tomography imaging likely distinguishes subgroups corresponding to 
neurochemically defined pathologies. Use of these positron emission tomography 
imaging methods may augment clinical classifications and allow selection of more 
uniform subject groups in disease-modifying therapeutic trials and other 
prospective research involving subjects in the early stages of dementia.

Dental Sciences, Japan.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Semantic dementia (SD) is a clinical subclassification of 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Patients with 'pure SD' present with semantic 
memory impairment preceding the frontal symptoms, and there have been no reports 
of familial cases.
METHODS: We evaluated the clinical features of, and performed neuropsychological 
examinations on, the proband and two affected family members. Then we performed 
neuroimaging and genetic analysis of MAPT and other dementia-related genes in 
the proband.
RESULTS: All three cases had semantic memory impairment with loss of word 
meanings as the primary early symptom. We diagnosed all cases as pure SD and 
identified a P301L mutation in the MAPT gene of the proband.
CONCLUSION: Although the P301L mutation identified here has been previously 
described as pathogenic for frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 
(FTDP-17), the proband and his two affected relatives showed different clinical 
symptoms from those of typical FTDP-17 cases who carry the P301L mutation. 
Pathologically, pure SD usually shows a TAR DNA-binding protein proteinopathy, 
but the molecular understanding of SD is not well established. Although our 
cases were clinically pure SD, the proband has a tau gene mutation, which would 
lead to tauopathy. These findings suggest that reconsideration of the molecular 
understanding of SD is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes around the time of menopause have the potential to 
impact on morbidity and eventual mortality. Here we review this topic to 
identify how such changes may improve health at perimenopause and beyond.
METHODS: Searches were performed in Medline and other databases. Each subject 
summary was presented to the ESHRE Workshop Group, where omissions or 
disagreements were resolved by discussion.
RESULTS: Body weight increases because the decline in physical activity during 
the perimenopause is greater than the concomitant decline in energy intake. It 
is imperative to stop smoking before menopause because the risk of acute 
myocardial infarction rises sharply thereafter. Cardiovascular events can be 
reduced by managing risk factors, such as hypertension and increased lipids and 
body weight. Breast cancer risk is increased to a similar extent by hormone use, 
decreased physical activity, increased calorie intake and alcohol use, all 
reflecting lifestyle decisions. Smoking, alcohol and exercise may increase or 
decrease risk of aging brain disorders, especially dementia and Parkinson's 
disease, while stress is consistently associated with increased risk and a 
prudent diet is consistently associated with reduced risk. Osteoarthritis 
frequency increases after 50 years of age and risk is elevated 3-fold by 
obesity, while risk of osteoporosis can be minimized by smoking cessation, 
adequate vitamin D intake and regular weight-bearing exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle changes around the time of the perimenopause can reduce 
the likelihood and severity of heart disease and chronic illness in later years 
and the cost of care of elderly women.

A deadly spread: cellular mechanisms of α-synuclein transfer.

Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

Classically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to dopamine neuron death in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta. Intracytoplasmic protein inclusions named Lewy 
bodies, and corresponding Lewy neurites found in neuronal processes, are also 
key features of the degenerative process in the substantia nigra. The molecular 
mechanisms by which substantia nigra dopamine neurons die and whether the Lewy 
pathology is directly involved in the cell death pathway are open questions. 
More recently, it has become apparent that Lewy pathology gradually involves 
greater parts of the PD brain and is widespread in late stages. In this review, 
we first discuss the role of misfolded α-synuclein protein, which is the main 
constituent of Lewy bodies, in the pathogenesis of PD. We then describe recent 
evidence that α-synuclein might transfer between cells in PD brains. We discuss 
in detail the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the proposed propagation 
and the likely consequences for cells that take up α-synuclein. Finally, we 
focus on aspects of the pathogenic process that could be targeted with new 
pharmaceutical therapies or used to develop biomarkers for early PD detection.

supranuclear palsy-like syndrome: broadening the clinical phenotype of TDP-43 
proteinopathies. A report of three cases.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive 
neuronal inclusions represents a novel entity (FTLD-TDP) that may be associated 
with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND); involvement of extrapyramidal and other 
systems has also been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present three cases with similar clinical symptoms, 
including Parkinsonism, supranuclear gaze palsy, visuospatial impairment and a 
behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, associated with either clinically 
possible or definite MND. Neuropathological examination revealed hallmarks of 
FTLD-TDP with major involvement of subcortical and, in particular, mesencephalic 
structures. These cases differed in onset and progression of clinical 
manifestations as well as distribution of histopathological changes in the brain 
and spinal cord. Two cases were sporadic, whereas the third case had a 
pathological variation in the progranulin gene 102 delC.
CONCLUSIONS: Association of a "progressive supranuclear palsy-like" syndrome 
with marked visuospatial impairment, motor neuron disease and early behavioral 
disturbances may represent a clinically distinct phenotype of FTLD-TDP. Our 
observations further support the concept that TDP-43 proteinopathies represent a 
spectrum of disorders, where preferential localization of pathogenetic 
inclusions and neuronal cell loss defines clinical phenotypes ranging from 
frontotemporal dementia with or without motor neuron disease, to corticobasal 
syndrome and to a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.

Some of the most prevalent human degenerative diseases appear as a result of the 
misfolding and aggregation of proteins. Compelling evidence suggest that 
misfolded protein aggregates play an important role in cell dysfunction and 
tissue damage, leading to the disease. Prion protein (Prion diseases), 
amyloid-beta (Alzheimer's disease), alpha-synuclein (Parkinson's disease), 
Huntingtin (Huntington's disease), serum amyloid A (AA amyloidosis) and islet 
amyloid polypeptide (type 2 diabetes) are some of the proteins that trigger 
disease when they get misfolded. The recent understanding of the crucial role of 
misfolded proteins as well as the structural requirements and mechanism of 
protein misfolding have raised the possibility that these diseases may be 
transmissible by self-propagation of the protein misfolding process in a similar 
way as the infamous prions transmit prion diseases. Future research in this 
field should aim to clarify this possibility and translate the knowledge of the 
basic disease mechanisms into development of novel strategies for early 
diagnosis and efficient treatment.

Longitudinal studies in nondemented Parkinson disease (PD) subjects offer an 
opportunity to study the earliest regional cerebral subcortical and cortical 
metabolic changes underlying incident dementia in this disorder.
METHODS: Twenty-three PD subjects without dementia (Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III; 
age, 61.8 ± 9.7 y; Mini-Mental State Examination, 28.0 ± 1.4) and 27 controls 
(age, 59.8 ± 11.5 y) underwent (18)F-FDG PET at study entry. PD subjects 
underwent yearly clinical assessment to determine conversion to dementia. The 
mean duration of follow-up was 3.9 ± 1.2 y (range, 2.0-6.8 y). Follow-up 
(18)F-FDG PET was available in a subset of subjects at 2 or more years. Both 
volume-of-interest and 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Six subjects became demented (PDD), with a mean time of 3.8 ± 1.7 y 
(range, 1.9-6.0 y) to development of dementia. Mean duration of disease before 
onset of dementia was 9.7 ± 4.2 y (range, 3.1-14 y). There were significant 
metabolic reductions in the occipital (-11.8% vs. controls, F((2,22)) = 7.0, P = 
0.002) and posterior cingulate (-12.1% vs. controls, F((2,22)) = 5.2, P = 0.009) 
cortices in PDD subjects at baseline, before diagnosis of dementia, compared 
with controls. Metabolism was most diminished in the visual association cortex 
(Brodmann area [BA] 18; -20.0% vs. control, F((2,22)) = 8.45, P = 0.0007) of PDD 
subjects. There was mild hypometabolism in the caudate nucleus (-8.4% vs. 
control, F((2,22)) = 3.2, P < 0.05). There was no significant hypometabolism in 
the temporal or frontal lobes. PD subjects who did not become demented 
(non-PDD), compared with controls, had reduced cerebral metabolism in the 
primary occipital cortex (BA 17) that was revealed only by 3D-SSP analysis. 
Follow-up scans in 5 PDD subjects at 2 y after study entry demonstrated a 
significant interval within-subject change in the thalamus (-11.4%), posterior 
cingulate (-9%), occipital (-7%), parietal (-7%), and frontal cortices (-7%) and 
mild reductions in the temporal cortex (-5%) and hippocampus (-3%), compared 
with study entry scans.
CONCLUSION: Incident dementia in idiopathic PD is heralded by decreased 
metabolism in the visual association (BA 18) and posterior cingulate cortices, 
with mild involvement also of the caudate nucleus. Two-year follow-up data from 
5 PDD converters show that progression to dementia is associated with mixed 
subcortical and cortical changes that involve the mesiofrontal lobes also. These 
findings provide insights into early metabolic features of parkinsonian 
dementia.

Language and behavior domains enhance the value of the clinical dementia rating 
scale.

Knopman DS(1), Weintraub S, Pankratz VS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. knopman@mayo.edu

BACKGROUND: The six domain standard Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRstd) has 
been successful for staging patients with the clinical syndrome of probable 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The CDRstd does not specifically address language 
dysfunction or alteration in personality and social behaviors which are 
prominent in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and primary 
progressive aphasia (PPA).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of adding domains of Language (LANG), and 
Behavior, Comportment, and Personality (BEHAV) to the CDRstd for the evaluation 
of patients with bvFTD and PPA.
METHODS: Two new domains, LANG and BEHAV, were constructed to parallel the six 
domains sampled in the CDRstd. Clinical and neuropsychological test data were 
obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. The dataset 
contained information on 2550 probable AD, 88 vascular dementia, 281 dementia 
with Lewy body, 234 bvFTD, and 137 PPA patients.
RESULTS: There were 76.5% of bvFTD and 99.3% of PPA patients with abnormal 
ratings (>0) on the LANG domain; 90.2% of bvFTD and 63.5% of PPA had abnormal 
ratings on the BEHAV domain. In patients with a CDRstd sum of boxes score of <4, 
53.7% of bvFTD had BEHAV domain and 78.6% of PPA patients had LANG domain 
scores>1. Among probable AD patients, 3.7% had LANG ratings that were ≥1 and 
3.8% had BEHAV ratings that were ≥1. Logistic regression analyses showed that 
adding either the LANG or BEHAV domains to the CDRstd sum of boxes score 
significantly improved the discrimination between probable AD, bvFTD, and PPA.
CONCLUSIONS: The new LANG and BEHAV domains add value to the CDRstd for the 
characterization of the nonamnestic symptoms that are prominent in patients with 
bvFTD and PPA but that also occur in those with probable AD.

OBJECTIVES: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) diagnosis often represents a 
challenge because of the high frequency of atypical presentations. Our aim was 
to describe the clinical features, APOE genotype, and its pathologic 
correlations of neuropathologic confirmed EOAD.
METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical data (age at onset, family history, 
clinical presentation, diagnostic delay, diagnosis) and APOE genotype of 
patients with neuropathologically confirmed EOAD (<60 years).
RESULTS: Forty cases were selected. Mean age at onset was 54.5 years (range 
46-60). The mean disease duration was 11 years with a mean diagnostic delay of 
3.1 years. A total of 37.5% had a nonmemory presentation. Behavioral/executive 
dysfunction was the most prevalent atypical presentation. Incorrect initial 
clinical diagnoses were common (53%) in patients with atypical presentations, 
but rare when anterograde amnesia was the presenting symptom (4%). The incorrect 
initial clinical diagnoses were 2 behavioral variant frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration, 2 normal pressure hydrocephalus, 1 semantic dementia, 1 primary 
progressive aphasia, 1 corticobasal degeneration, 1 pseudodementia with 
depression, and 1 unclassifiable dementia. APOE genotype was ε3/ε3 in 59%, with 
no significant differences between typical and atypical presentations. APOE ε4 
was 3.3 times more frequent in subjects with family history of AD. A total of 
97.5% of the cases presented advanced neurofibrillary pathology. A total of 45% 
of the patients had concomitant Lewy body pathology although localized in most 
cases and without a significant clinical correlate.
CONCLUSION: One third of patients with pathologic confirmed EOAD presented with 
atypical symptoms. Patients with EOAD with nonamnestic presentations often 
receive incorrect clinical diagnoses.

gregor.wenning@i-med.ac.at

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) comprise a 
heterogenous group of disorders including multiple system atrophy (MSA), 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 
corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Based on literature published in 2010, we here 
review recent advances in the APD field.
RECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies have provided robust evidence 
of increased disease risk conferred by synuclein and tau gene variants in MSA 
and PSP. Furthermore, advanced imaging tools have been established in the 
differential diagnosis and as surrogate markers of disease activity in patients 
with APDs. Finally, although therapeutic options are still disappointing, 
translational research into disease-modifying strategies has accelerated with 
the increasing availability of transgenic animal models, particularly for MSA.
SUMMARY: Remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of APDs, and 
advances in the genetics, molecular biology and neuroimaging of these disorders 
will continue to facilitate intensified clinical trial activity.

Hallucinations in neurodegenerative diseases.

Patients with neurodegenerative disease frequently experience hallucinations and 
illusionary perceptions. As early symptoms, hallucinations may even have 
diagnostic relevance (i.e., for the diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia). In the 
later course of the disease, hallucinations may appear as characteristic 
symptoms and often constitute a particular challenge for therapeutic endeavors. 
Here, the distinction of disease-inherent hallucinations from 
medication-associated perceptual disturbances is particularly relevant. 
Synucleinopathies and tauopathies have different risk profiles for 
hallucinations. In synucleinopathies hallucinations are much more frequent and 
phenomenology is characterized by visual, short-lived hallucinations, with 
insight preserved for a long time. A “double hit” theory proposes that 
dysfunctionality of both associative visual areas and changes of limbic areas or 
the ventral striatum are required. In contrast, in tauopathies the 
hallucinations are more rare and mostly embedded in confusional states with 
agitation and with poorly defined or rapidly changing paranoia. The occurrence 
of hallucinations has even been proposed as an exclusion criterion for 
tauopathies with Parkinsonian features such as progressive supranuclear palsy. 
To date, treatment remains largely empirical, except the use of clozapine and 
cholinesterase inhibitors in synucleinopathies, which is evidence-based. The 
risk of increased neuroleptic sensitivity further restricts the treatment 
options in patients with Lewy Body Dementia. Coping Strategies and improvement 
of visual acuity and sleep quality may be useful therapeutic complements.

BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the natural history of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease (PD) remains limited. In the era of potential disease modifying 
therapies, there is an urgent need for studies assessing the natural evolution 
of treated PD from onset so that relevant outcome measures can be identified for 
clinical trials. No previous studies have charted progression in unselected 
patients followed from the point of diagnosis.
METHODS: A representative cohort of 132 PD patients was followed from diagnosis 
for up to 7.9 years (mean 5.2 years). Comprehensive clinical and 
neuropsychological evaluations were performed every 18 months. Disease 
progression was evaluated using well validated clinical measures (motor 
progression and development of dyskinesia on the Unified PD Rating Scale and 
Hoehn-Yahr scale, dementia onset according to DSM-IV criteria). Multi-level 
linear modelling was used to chart the nature and rate of progression in 
parkinsonian symptoms and signs over time. The prognostic importance of baseline 
demogr‘aphic, clinical and genetic variables was evaluated using survival 
analysis.
RESULTS: Axial (gait and postural) symptoms evolve more rapidly than other motor 
features of PD and appear to be the best index of disease progression. 
Conversely, conventional outcome measures are relatively insensitive to change 
over time. Earlier onset of postural instability (Hoehn-Yahr stage 3) is 
strongly associated with increased age at disease onset and has a significant 
impact on quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia risk is associated with increased age, impaired baseline 
semantic fluency and the MAPT H1/H1 genotype. The efficacy of disease modifying 
therapies may be more meaningfully assessed in terms of their effects in 
delaying the major milestones of PD, such as postural instability and dementia, 
since it is these that have the greatest impact on patients.

Preliminary studies have shown associations between chronic pesticide exposure 
in occupational settings and neurological disorders. However, data on the 
effects of long-term non-occupational exposures are too sparse to allow any 
conclusions. This study examines the influence of environmental pesticide 
exposure on a number of neuropsychiatric conditions and discusses their 
underlying pathologic mechanisms. An ecological study was conducted using 
averaged prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple 
sclerosis, cerebral degeneration, polyneuropathies, affective psychosis and 
suicide attempts in selected Andalusian health districts categorized into areas 
of high and low environmental pesticide exposure based on the number of hectares 
devoted to intensive agriculture and pesticide sales per capita. A total of 
17,429 cases were collected from computerized hospital records (minimum dataset) 
between 1998 and 2005. Prevalence rates and the risk of having Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and suicide were significantly 
higher in districts with greater pesticide use as compared to those with lower 
pesticide use. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in 
areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and 
suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for 
polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts. In conclusion, this 
study supports and extends previous findings and provides an indication that 
environmental exposure to pesticides may affect the human health by increasing 
the incidence of certain neurological disorders at the level of the general 
population.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of cognitive function with the risk of 
incident mobility impairments and the rate of declining mobility in older 
adults.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study.
SETTING: Retirement communities across metropolitan Chicago.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,154 ambulatory elders from two longitudinal studies 
without baseline clinical dementia or history of stroke or Parkinson disease.
MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent baseline cognitive testing and annual 
mobility examinations. Mobility impairments were based on annual timed walking 
performance. A composite mobility measure, which summarized gait and balance 
measures, was used to examine the annual rate of mobility change.
RESULTS: During follow-up of 4.5 years, 423 of 836 (50.6%) participants 
developed impaired mobility. In a proportional hazards model controlled for age, 
sex, education, and race, each 1-unit higher level of baseline global cognition 
was associated with a reduction to about half in the risk of mobility 
impairments (hazard ratio = 0.51, 95% confidence interval: 0.40-0.66) and was 
similar to a participant being about 13 years younger at baseline. These results 
did not vary by sex or race and were unchanged in analyses controlling for body 
mass index, physical activity, vascular diseases, and risk factors. The level of 
cognition in five different cognitive abilities was also related to incident 
mobility impairment. Cognition showed similar associations with incident loss of 
the ability to ambulate. Linear mixed-effects models showed that global 
cognition at baseline was associated with the rate of declining mobility.
CONCLUSIONS: Among ambulatory elders, cognition is associated with incident 
mobility impairment and mobility decline.

Milestones in Parkinson's disease--clinical and pathologic features.

The identification of the widespread deposition of fibrillized α-synuclein in 
Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease 
in 1997 has had a profound impact on how the disease is now conceptualized. The 
previous focus on the loss of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, the concept 
of subcortical dementia, and the idea that Parkinson's disease was dominated by 
motor impairment have all given way to research assessing more diverse brain 
regions, clinical symptoms, and phenotypes. It is now recognized that 
Parkinson's disease is more than just a loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in 
association with Lewy bodies. There are now several theories on how the disease 
develops and progresses currently being validated in a variety of studies, 
although many of these theories have yet to incorporate the phenotypic clinical 
and pathological changes associated with age. A particularly exciting new area 
of research involves the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic proteins. The 
recent consensus definition of Parkinson's disease dementia will allow its 
pathologic substrates to be determined. These advances have progressed to a 
stage where the preclinical stages of Parkinson's disease and its specific signs 
and symptoms are being predicted and tested clinically. Such strategies herald a 
future wave of preventive strategies for Parkinson's disease and its clinical 
symptoms.

Milestones in Parkinson's disease therapeutics.

In the mid-1980s, the treatment of Parkinson's disease was quite exclusively 
centered on dopatherapy and was focusing on dopamine systems and motor symptoms. 
A few dopamine agonists and a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (selegiline) were 
used as adjuncts in advanced Parkinson's disease. In the early 2010s, levodopa 
remains the gold standard. New insights into the organization of the basal 
ganglia paved the way for deep brain stimulation, especially of the subthalamic 
nucleus, providing spectacular improvement of drug-refractory levodopa-induced 
motor complications. Novel dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, 
rotigotine), catecholmethyltransferase inhibitors (entacapone), and monoamine 
oxidase B inhibitors (rasagiline) have also been developed to provide more 
continuous oral delivery of dopaminergic stimulation in order to improve motor 
outcomes. Using dopamine agonists early, before levodopa, proved to delay the 
onset of dyskinesia, although this is achieved at the price of potentially 
disabling daytime somnolence or impulse control disorders. The demonstration of 
an antidyskinetic effect of the glutamate antagonist amantadine opened the door 
for novel nondopaminergic approaches of Parkinson's disease therapy. More 
recently, nonmotor symptoms (depression, dementia, and psychosis) have been the 
focus of the first randomized controlled trials in this field. Despite 
therapeutic advances, Parkinson's disease continues to be a relentlessly 
progressive disorder leading to severe disability. Neuroprotective interventions 
able to modify the progression of Parkinson's disease have stood out as a failed 
therapeutic goal over the last 2 decades, despite potentially encouraging 
results with compounds like rasagiline. Newer molecular targets, new animal 
models, novel clinical trial designs, and biomarkers to assess disease 
modification have created hope for future therapeutic interventions.

During the last decades, atypical parkinsonian disorders such as multiple system 
atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, and 
corticobasal degeneration along with secondary parkinsonian disorders have been 
increasingly recognized as important causes of parkinsonism. Although treatment 
options are largely limited to date, remarkable progress has occurred through 
advances in the fields of molecular biology and diagnostic neuroimaging, 
resulting in intense preclinical drug discovery programs. 
Early-investigation-assisted clinical diagnosis has become more crucial than 
ever because disease-modifying therapies will hopefully become available within 
this decade.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder 
and is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the 
substantia nigra. Dopamine replacement drugs remain the most effective PD 
treatment but only provide temporary symptomatic relief. New therapies are 
urgently needed, but the search for a disease-modifying treatment and a 
definitive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD has been limited by 
the lack of physiologically relevant models that recapitulate the disease 
phenotype. The use of immortalized cell lines as in vitro model systems for drug 
discovery has met with limited success, since efficacy and safety too often fail 
to translate successfully in human clinical trials. Drug discoverers are 
shifting their focus to more physiologically relevant cellular models, including 
primary neurons and stem cells. The recent discovery of induced pluripotent stem 
(iPS) cell technology presents an exciting opportunity to derive human DA 
neurons from patients with sporadic and familial forms of PD. We anticipate that 
these human DA models will recapitulate key features of the PD phenotype. In 
parallel, high-content screening platforms, which extract information on 
multiple cellular features within individual neurons, provide a network-based 
approach that can resolve temporal and spatial relationships underlying 
mechanisms of neurodegeneration and drug perturbations. These emerging 
technologies have the potential to establish highly predictive cellular models 
that could bring about a desperately needed revolution in PD drug discovery.

disease.

The basal ganglia are involved in the preferential selection and suppression of 
competing responses. Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are 2 
prototypical basal ganglia disorders that feature impaired inhibitory control, a 
function of poor conflict resolution. Previous saccadic studies showed that 
individuals with Parkinson's disease experience difficulty suppressing unwanted 
ocular motor responses, whereas evidence for a similar difficulty in 
Huntington's disease is more equivocal. Relative to saccades, few research 
studies have examined inhibitory control processes in the context of an ongoing 
smooth pursuit task. In this study, we examined the ability of 16 patients with 
Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Huntington's disease to suppress 
automatic responses to irrelevant distracters that transiently appeared during 
the tracking of a moving visual stimulus. Compared with an equivalent number of 
age-matched controls, patients with Parkinson's disease generated 
proportionately more saccades to distracter stimuli. This was particularly 
evident for distracters appearing far away from the target. Conversely, whereas 
individuals with early-stage Huntington's disease and healthy controls made a 
comparable number of errors toward distracter stimuli, those in a more advanced 
clinical stage demonstrated significantly poorer inhibitory control. The current 
findings in parkinsonian patients replicate those previously reported in the 
saccadic and manual response literature, demonstrating difficulty inhibiting a 
competing motor response. However, in Huntington's disease we demonstrate for 
the first time that inhibitory control declines in more advanced-disease stages. 
This suggests that ocular motility may provide a sensitive marker of clinical 
disease progression in Huntington's disease.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures as predictive 
biomarkers for the development of dementia in Parkinson disease (PD). 
Preliminary work shows that QEEG measures correlate with current PD cognitive 
state. A reliable predictive QEEG biomarker for PD dementia (PD-D) incidence 
would be valuable for studying PD-D, including treatment trials aimed at 
preventing cognitive decline in PD.
METHODS: A cohort of subjects with PD in our brain donation program utilizes 
annual premortem longitudinal movement and cognitive evaluation. These subjects 
also undergo biennial EEG recording. EEG from subjects with PD without dementia 
with follow-up cognitive evaluation was analyzed for QEEG measures of background 
rhythm frequency and relative power in δ, , α, and β bands. The relationship 
between the time to onset of dementia and QEEG and other possible predictors was 
assessed by using Cox regression.
RESULTS: The hazard of developing dementia was 13 times higher for those with 
low background rhythm frequency (lower than the grand median of 8.5 Hz) than for 
those with high background rhythm frequency (p < 0.001). Hazard ratios (HRs) 
were also significant for > median bandpower (HR = 3.0; p = 0.004) compared to 
below, and for certain neuropsychological measures. The HRs for δ, α, and β 
bandpower as well as baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not 
significant.
CONCLUSION: The QEEG measures of background rhythm frequency and relative power 
in the band are potential predictive biomarkers for dementia incidence in PD. 
These QEEG biomarkers may be useful in complementing neuropsychological testing 
for studying PD-D incidence.

Clinical features and multidisciplinary approaches to dementia care.

Grand JH(1), Caspar S, Macdonald SW.

Dementia is a clinical syndrome of widespread progressive deterioration of 
cognitive abilities and normal daily functioning. These cognitive and behavioral 
impairments pose considerable challenges to individuals with dementia, along 
with their family members and caregivers. Four primary dementia classifications 
have been defined according to clinical and research criteria: 1) Alzheimer's 
disease; 2) vascular dementias; 3) frontotemporal dementias; and 4) dementia 
with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia. The cumulative efforts of 
multidisciplinary healthcare teams have advanced our understanding of dementia 
beyond basic descriptions, towards a more complete elucidation of risk factors, 
clinical symptoms, and neuropathological correlates. The characterization of 
disease subtypes has facilitated targeted management strategies, advanced 
treatments, and symptomatic care for individuals affected by dementia. This 
review briefly summarizes the current state of knowledge and directions of 
dementia research and clinical practice. We provide a description of the risk 
factors, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis of dementia. A 
summary of multidisciplinary team approaches to dementia care is outlined, 
including management strategies for the treatment of cognitive impairments, 
functional deficits, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. The 
needs of individuals with dementia are extensive, often requiring care beyond 
traditional bounds of medical practice, including pharmacologic and 
non-pharmacologic management interventions. Finally, advanced research on the 
early prodromal phase of dementia is reviewed, with a focus on change-point 
models, trajectories of cognitive change, and threshold models of pathological 
burden. Future research goals are outlined, with a call to action for social 
policy initiatives that promote preventive lifestyle behaviors, and healthcare 
programs that will support the growing number of individuals affected by 
dementia.

There is controversy regarding the definition and characteristics of mild 
cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. The Movement Disorder Society 
commissioned a Task Force to critically evaluate the literature and determine 
the frequency and characteristics of Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive 
impairment and its association with dementia. A comprehensive PubMed literature 
review was conducted using systematic inclusion and exclusion criteria. A mean 
of 26.7% (range, 18.9%-38.2%) of nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease 
have mild cognitive impairment. The frequency of Parkinson's disease-mild 
cognitive impairment increases with age, disease duration, and disease severity. 
Impairments occur in a range of cognitive domains, but single domain impairment 
is more common than multiple domain impairment, and within single domain 
impairment, nonamnestic is more common than amnestic impairment. A high 
proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive impairment 
progress to dementia in a relatively short period of time. The primary 
conclusions of the Task Force are that: (1) Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive 
impairment is common, (2) there is significant heterogeneity within Parkinson's 
disease-mild cognitive impairment in the number and types of cognitive domain 
impairments, (3) Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive impairment appears to place 
patients at risk of progressing to dementia, and (4) formal diagnostic criteria 
for Parkinson's disease-mild cognitive impairment are needed.

Aside from limb tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and gait disturbances, 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is also characterized by non-motor symptoms. A 
cognitive decline can occur early in the disease course and undoubtedly impact 
of the patient's quality of life. Dementia affects 80% of patients 20 years 
after disease onset but a small subgroup of patients remain free of dementia 
even after decades with PD. Risk factors and diagnosis of dementia can be easily 
assessed using bed-side clinical instruments. Advances in genetics and imagery 
will allow improving the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy dementia in 
Parkinson's disease.

Clinical findings in Parkinson's disease suggest that most patients 
progressively develop disabling non-levodopa-responsive symptoms during the 
course of the disease. Nevertheless, several heterogeneous factors, such as 
clinical phenotype, age at onset and genetic aspects may influence the long-term 
clinical picture. In order to investigate the main features of long-term 
Parkinson's disease progression, we studied a cohort of 19 subjects treated with 
subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation after >20 years of disease, reporting 
clinical and neuropsychological data up to a mean of 30 years from disease 
onset. This group of patients was characterized by an early onset of disease, 
with a mean age of 38.63 years at Parkinson's disease onset, which was 
significantly lower than in the other long-term subthalamic nucleus deep brain 
stimulation follow-up cohorts reported in the literature. All subjects were 
regularly evaluated by a complete Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a 
battery of neuropsychological tests and a clinical interview, intended to assess 
the rate of non-levodopa-responsive symptom progression. Clinical data were 
available for all patients at presurgical baseline and at 1, 3 and 5 years from 
the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation surgical procedure, while 
follow-up data after >7 years were additionally reported in a subgroup of 14 
patients. The clinical and neuropsychological performance progressively worsened 
during the course of follow-up; 64% of patients gradually developed falls, 86% 
dysphagia, 57% urinary incontinence and 43% dementia. A progressive worsening of 
motor symptoms was observed both in 'medication-ON' condition and in 
'stimulation-ON' condition, with a parallel reduction in the synergistic effect 
of 'medication-ON/stimulation-ON' condition. Neuropsychological data also showed 
a gradual decline in the performances of all main cognitive domains, with an 
initial involvement of executive functions, followed by the impairment of 
language, reasoning and memory. Thirty years after the disease onset, most 
patients presented non-levodopa-responsive symptoms, although the effect of both 
subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapies still 
showed significant efficacy on the main disease cardinal features. Nevertheless, 
compared with other subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation follow-up 
studies, which included patients with a shorter disease duration at the time of 
surgery, a higher prevalence of axial and non-levodopa-responsive symptoms was 
observed in the long-term evaluations, confirming that several complex aspects 
underlie the development of non-motor symptoms and other features of Parkinson's 
disease progression, even in patients with an early disease onset and a prior 
long-lasting response to dopaminergic therapies.

[Evaluation of shortened protocol of graph plot method with ¹²³I-IMP].

The (123)I-IMP Graph Plot is a convenient method of analyzing cerebral blood 
flow without blood sampling. Data acquisition requires 45 minutes after the 
infusion of (123)I-IMP because the method is matched to the protocol of 
autoradiography (conventional method). However, we think that those protocols do 
not have to be matched because those theories are different. Therefore, we 
contrived a protocol for shortening that time by beginning SPECT data 
acquisition earlier and shortening the acquisition time compared to the 
conventional method. We compared count ratios of the decreased area to an area 
of the healthy side, quantitative values, and results of statistical analysis of 
the shortened protocol and the conventional method for cases of cerebral 
infarction and of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Some count ratios of the 
shortened protocol were inferior to those of the conventional method, but the 
degrees did not affect the clinical diagnosis. In the other areas and cases 
also, the differences did not affect the clinical diagnosis. In addition to the 
results of this study, some previous reports have described that early SPECT 
images after infusion show the true cerebral blood flow. Therefore, we judged 
that this shortened protocol can be used as a clinical protocol.

OBJECTIVES: Hypovitaminosis D as a result of malnutrition or sunlight 
deprivation, increased bone resorption, low bone mineral density (BMD), or an 
increased risk of falls may contribute to an increased risk of hip fractures in 
patients with neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
disease, and stroke. The purpose of this study was to clarify the efficacy of 
sunlight exposure for reducing the risk of hip fractures in patients with such 
neurological diseases.
METHODS: The English literature was searched using PubMed, and randomized 
controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of sunlight exposure for reducing the 
risk of hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and stroke were identified. The relative risk and the 95% confidence interval 
were calculated for individual randomized controlled trials, and a pooled data 
analysis (meta-analysis) was performed.
RESULTS: Three randomized controlled trials were identified. Sunlight exposure 
improved hypovitaminosis D and increased the BMD. The relative risk (95% 
confidence interval) of hip fractures was 0.22 (0.05, 1.01) for Alzheimer's 
disease, 0.27 (0.08, 0.96) for Parkinson's disease, and 0.17 (0.02, 1.36) for 
stroke. The relative risk (95% confidence interval) calculated for the pooled 
data analysis was 0.23 (0.10, 0.56) (P = 0.0012), suggesting a significant risk 
reduction rate of 77%.
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis added additional evidence indicating the 
efficacy of sunlight exposure for reducing the risk of hip fractures in patients 
with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.

Lewy bodies composed of aggregates of α-synuclein (αS) in the brain are the main 
histopathological features of Lewy body diseases (LBD) such as Parkinson's 
disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Mutations such as E46K, A30P and A53T in 
the αS gene cause autosomal dominant LBD in a number of kindreds. Although these 
mutations accelerate fibril formation, their precise effects at early stages of 
the αS aggregation process remain unknown. To answer this question, we examined 
the aggregation including monomer conformational dynamics and oligomerization of 
the E46K, A30P, A53T and A30P/A53T mutations and wild type (WT) using thioflavin 
S assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy, photo-induced cross-linking of 
unmodified proteins, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Relative 
to WT αS, E46K αS accelerated the kinetics of the secondary structure change and 
oligomerization, whereas A30P αS decelerated them. These effects were reflected 
in changes in average oligomer size. The mutant oligomers of E46K αS functioned 
as fibril seeds significantly more efficiently than those of WT αS, whereas the 
mutant oligomers of A30P αS were less efficient. Our results that mutations of 
familial LBD had opposite effects at early stages of αS assembly may provide new 
insight into the molecular mechanisms of LBD.

Comparable to Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's 
disease (PD-MCI) is associated with an increased risk for dementia. However 
different definitions of PD-MCI may have varying predictive accuracy for 
dementia. In a cohort of 101 nondemented Parkinson patients who underwent 
neuropsychological testing, the frequency of PD-MCI subjects and PD-MCI subtypes 
(i.e., amnestic/nonamnestic) was determined by use of varying healthy 
population-based cut-off values. We also investigated the association between 
defined PD-MCI groups and ADL scales. Varying cut-off values for the definition 
of PD-MCI were found to affect frequency of PD-MCI subjects (9.9%-92.1%) and, 
maybe more important, lead to a "shift" of proportion of detected PD-MCI 
subtypes especially within the amnestic single-domain subtype. Models using a 
strict cut-off value were significantly associated with lower ADL scores. Thus, 
the use of defined cut-off values for the definition of PD-MCI is highly 
relevant for comparison purposes. Strict cut-off values may have a higher 
predictive value for dementia.

Cognitive impairment exists in Parkinson's disease (PD) as a transitional state 
between cognitively intact and demented PD patients. It seems to be a risk 
factor for the development of dementia in PD, but the precise criteria and 
unfavorable cognitive profile of mild cognitive impairment in PD (MCI-PD) have 
not yet been established. The concept may turn to be different from that in 
Alzheimer's disease since we search for those already diagnosed PD patients who 
are at risk of developing dementia. In addition, clinical variables specific for 
PD also play role. Importantly, MCI possesses a metabolic basis in PD. Various 
biomarkers particularly including neuropsychological testing and the brain 
imaging hold promise in identification of MCI-PD patients with unfavorable 
prognoses. Well-designed longitudinal studies in MCI-PD cohorts are needed to 
assess the sensitivity and specificity of the PD-MCI designation as far as 
dementia development is concerned.

Neurology), University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany. kelly.del-tredici@uni-ulm.de

The accumulation of Lewy pathology (LP) within autonomic nervous system tissues 
has received increased attention recently as a possible induction site for Lewy 
neurodegeneration and a possible source of biopsy material for biomarkers of 
early Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we describe LP accumulation within various 
tissues involving peripheral autonomic nervous system neurons in three PD cases 
and one case of incidental Lewy body disease. Findings highlight the value of 
examining pathology within functional neuroanatomical systems and particularly 
the importance of Lewy neurites (LNs) in the pathophysiology of PD.

BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 1,200 people under the age of 65 have been 
diagnosed with dementia in Norway. This article provides an overview of the 
types of dementia frequently seen in younger patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on a non-systematic search in PubMed, 
as well as the authors' own clinical and research experience.
RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia and 
dementia with Lewy bodies, are the most common types of dementia occurring more 
often in younger than in older patients. The cognitive symptoms are more 
variable in younger patients than in older. Only a small percentage of early 
onset dementia is caused by genetic factors. There are few diagnostic tools 
available for this age group and it takes considerable time to reach a correct 
diagnosis. Early diagnosis allows the patient and carer to plan for the future.
INTERPRETATION: Physicians should be aware that dementia can occur in younger 
people, and more diagnostic assessments should be developed for this patient 
group. Better coordination from the public health authority and municipalities 
is needed to provide respite care for early onset dementia patients and their 
carers.

Is all cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease "mild cognitive impairment"?

Autonoma de Barcelona, Sant Antoni M. Claret 167, 08025, Barcelona, Spain.

Cognitive impairment can be demonstrated in Parkinson's disease (PD) from the 
very beginning of the disease. Clinical manifestations range from slight 
deficits, only demonstrable by means of neuropsychological testing, up to 
dementia. If a linear involution is supposed for the cognitive worsening in PD, 
then the relatively subtle cognitive defects should be taken as the earliest 
signs of dementia implying that PD-MCI concept would be thoroughly equivalent to 
that used for the early prediction of other dementias among healthy population. 
Cognitive defects in PD, however, may not follow a normal distribution. While 
fronto-striatal deficits, such as working memory, set-shifting and free-recall 
verbal memory appear altered in most patients during long periods of time, 
certain functions depending on more posterior-cortical regions, such as copying 
or naming, usually characterize patients with dementia. Fronto-striatal and 
posterior-cortical cognitive defects may have a different pathophysiological 
substrates, evolution and prognosis. While fronto-striatal defects appear more 
related to dopaminergic defects, posterior-cortical defects may obey multiple 
neurotransmitter failure. Designing criteria to accurately diagnose PD-MCI is 
highly relevant for clinical treatment, research, care-giving and 
decision-making. Besides quantitative defects, an operative definition of MCI in 
PD should clearly distinguish a "risky cognitive profile" among the broad 
cognitive defects intrinsic to PD. Thus, along with other possible biological 
markers, from a neuropsychological point of view, posterior-cortical defects 
probably represent the very syndrome of MCI in PD.

Identifying patients at higher risk of developing dementia is important. The 
usefulness of the Mattis Dementia Rating scale-Second Edition (MDRS-2) to detect 
and differentiate between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment 
(A-MCI), Parkinson's disease and MCI (PD-MCI), PD with dementia (PDD), and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) was investigated. In all, 22 healthy controls (HC), 22 
A-MCI, 22 PD-MCI, 16 PDD, and 22 AD patients were evaluated using an extensive 
neuropsychological battery, including the MDRS-2. The MDRS-2 total standardized 
score detected all groups of patients. The dementia groups performed worse than 
HC on the 5 MDRS-2 subscales. Alzheimer's disease patients scored higher than 
PDD on MDRS-2 conceptualization and lower on memory. Healthy controls were 
better than PD-MCI on MDRS-2 initiation/perseveration and memory and better than 
A-MCI on memory. No difference was found between the MCI groups. The MDRS-2 is a 
suitable short scale for MCI and dementia screening but is not specific enough 
to differentiate between A-MCI and PD-MCI.

BACKGROUND: Neuroregeneration is a relatively recent concept that includes 
neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and neurorestoration--implantation of viable 
cells as a therapeutical approach.
DISCUSSION: Neurogenesis and neuroplasticity are impaired in brains of patients 
suffering from Alzheimer's Disease or Parkinson's Disease and correlate with low 
endogenous protection, as a result of a diminished growth factors expression. 
However, we hypothesize that the brain possesses, at least in early and medium 
stages of disease, a "neuroregenerative reserve", that could be exploited by 
growth factors or stem cells-neurorestoration therapies.
SUMMARY: In this paper we review the current data regarding all three aspects of 
neuroregeneration in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.

Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PD-D) is one of the most important non-motor signs 
in advanced PD and is the most influencing factor predicting nursing home 
placement. PD-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) is a potential 
prodromal stage of PD-D. The Grand Total EEG (GTE) score is a rating scale for 
clinical EEG (Electroencephalography) analyses which is useful in the evaluation 
of different types of dementia. The purpose of the present study was to 
investigate the relationship between a short version of the GTE score and 
severity of cognitive deficits in PD. Nineteen patients with PD underwent 
neuropsychological testing and resting state EEG. Significant correlations with 
deteriorating cognition (combined Mini Mental Status Examination/Clock Drawing 
Test) were found for the overall short GTE score (Spearman Rank correlation, 
ρ=-.6; p<.05) and for the subscore "Frequency of Rhythmic Background Activity" 
(ρ=-.6; p<.05), indicating that these EEG measures increase with deteriorating 
cognition.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a major risk factor for cerebral and 
peripheral vascular diseases, as well as cortical and hippocampal injury, 
including an increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment. Elevated serum 
homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations are common in patients with Parkinson's 
disease (PD) who have been treated with levodopa; however, physical exercises 
can help reduce Hcy concentrations. The aim of the present study was to compare 
serum Hcy levels in patients with PD who partook in regular physical exercises, 
sedentary PD patients, and healthy controls.
METHODS: Sixty individuals were enrolled in the present study across three 
groups: (i) 17 patients who did not partake of any type of exercise; (ii) 24 PD 
patients who exercised regularly; and (iii) 19 healthy individuals who did not 
exercise regularly. All participants were evaluated by Hoehn and Yahr scale, the 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Schwab and England scale 
(measure daily functionality). The serum levels of Hcy were analyzed by blood 
samples collected of each participant. An analysis of variance and a Tukey's 
post hoc test were applied to compare and to verify differences between groups. 
Pearson's correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses were used to 
consider the association between several variables.
RESULTS: Mean plasma Hcy concentrations in individuals who exercised regularly 
were similar to those in the healthy controls and significantly lower than those 
in the group that did not exercise at all (P= 0.000). In addition, patients who 
did not exercise were receiving significantly higher doses of levodopa than 
those patients who exercised regularly (P= 0.001). A positive relationship 
between levodopa dose and Hcy concentrations (R(2) = 0.27; P= 0.03) was observed 
in patients who did not exercise, but not in those patients who exercised 
regularly (R(2) = 0.023; P= 0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that, even with regular 
levodopa therapy, Hcy concentrations in PD patients who exercise regularly are 
significantly lower than in patients who do not exercise and are similar Hcy 
concentrations in healthy controls.

The SCA17 clinical phenotype includes characteristics associated with cerebellar 
and cortical atrophy such as ataxia, dementia, epilepsy, chorea and parkinsonian 
features. Here we describe the case of a 38-year-old male presenting with 
ataxia, cognitive impairment and seizures, who was found to carry 43 repeats on 
one allele of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Therefore, genetic analysis 
of TBP gene triplets was performed on the patient's entire family, identifying 
three asymptomatic carriers of the same allele. A neuroradiological phenotype 
appeared to segregate with this allele, suggesting that it may play at least a 
contributory role in the determination of SCA17.

Depression in elderly patients with Alzheimer dementia or vascular dementia and 
its influence on their quality of life.

Department.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the most 
common causes of dementia in the elderly. Depression is an important co-morbid 
disorder in these diseases, which is often challenging to recognize. We 
investigated the prevalence of depression in patients with AD and VD and 
estimated the influence of depression on the health-related quality of life 
(HrQoL) in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated prevalence of depression in consecutively 
recruited patients with AD or VD (n= 98). Depression was diagnosed according to 
criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) 
and scored using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The EuroQol (EQ-5D and visual 
analogue scale) was applied to evaluate HrQoL. The severity of cognitive 
impairment was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple 
regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting severity of 
depression.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in AD/VD was 87%. In comparison to the 
general population, HrQoL measured on the visual analogue scale was reduced by 
54% in patients with AD/VD. In the dimension "anxiety/depression" of the EQ-5D, 
81% of patients with AD/VD had moderate or severe problems. Depression showed 
significant association with reduced HrQoL (P<0.01). Independent predictors of 
more severe depression were older age, male gender, better MMSE scores and being 
not married.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in patients with 
AD/VD, which is often under-diagnosed being masked by cognitive impairment. 
Depression is a predictor of reduced HrQoL in elder people with AD/VD. 
Therefore, they should be screened for presence of depressive symptoms and 
receive adequate antidepressant treatment.

Visual hallucinations (VH) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and lead to a 
poor quality of life. For a long time, dopaminergic therapy was considered to be 
the most important risk factor for the development of VH in PD. Recently, the 
cholinergic system, including the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), has been 
implicated in the pathophysiology of VH. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate grey matter density of the PPN region and one of its projection 
areas, the thalamus. Thirteen non-demented PD patients with VH were compared to 
16 non-demented PD patients without VH, 13 demented PD patients (PDD) with VH 
and 11 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Isotropic 3-D T1-weighted 
MRI images (3T) were analysed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with the PPN 
region and thalamus as ROIs. PD and PDD patients with VH showed grey matter 
reductions of the PPN region and the thalamus compared to PD patients without 
VH. VH in PD(D) patients are associated with atrophy of the PPN region and its 
thalamic target area, suggesting that a cholinergic deficit may be involved in 
the development of VH in PD(D).

An SRp75/hnRNPG complex interacting with hnRNPE2 regulates the 5' splice site of 
tau exon 10, whose misregulation causes frontotemporal dementia.

Tau is a neuronal-specific microtubule-associated protein that plays an 
important role in establishing neuronal polarity and maintaining the axonal 
cytoskeleton. Aggregated tau is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs), structures present in the brains of people affected by neurodegenerative 
diseases called tauopathies. Tauopathies include Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-17), the early onset dementia 
observed in Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) and the dementia component of 
myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Splicing misregulation of adult-specific exon 
10, which codes for a microtubule binding domain, results in expression of 
abnormal ratios of tau isoforms, leading to FTDP-17. Positions 3 to 19 of the 
intron downstream of exon 10 define a hotspot of splicing regulation: the region 
diverges between humans and rodents, and point mutations within it result in 
tauopathies. In this study, we investigated three regulators of exon 10 
splicing: serine/arginine-rich protein SRp75 and heterogeneous nuclear 
ribonucleoproteins hnRNPG and hnRNPE2. SRp75 and hnRNPG inhibit splicing of exon 
10 whereas hnRNPE2 activates it. Using co-transfections, co-immunoprecipitations 
and RNAi we discovered that SRp75 binds to the proximal downstream intron of tau 
exon 10 at the FTDP-17 hotspot region; and that hnRNPG and hnRNPE2 interact with 
SRp75. Thus, increased exon 10 inclusion in FTDP mutants may arise from weakened 
SRp75 binding. This work provides insights into the splicing regulation of the 
tau gene and into possible strategies for correcting the imbalance in 
tauopathies caused by changes in the ratio of exon 10.

We examined apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes in relation to Parkinson's disease 
(PD) among 786 cases and 1537 controls, all non-Hispanic Caucasians. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from multivariate logistic 
regression models, adjusting for year of birth, sex, smoking status, daily 
caffeine intake, and family history of PD. Compared with participants with ApoE 
ε33, ε4 carriers (ε34/ε44) had significantly lower odds for having PD (OR, 0.75; 
95% CI, 0.59-0.94; p = 0.01), whereas ε2 carriers (ε23/ε22) did not (OR, 0.95; 
95% CI, 0.73-1.24; p = 0.71). Subgroup analyses showed similar results. In 
addition, we conducted a meta-analysis which confirmed our primary findings 
(ε34/ε44 vs. ε33: OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99; p = 0.024 and ε23/ε22 vs. ε33: 
OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97-1.23; p = 0.13). In PD patients, the prevalence of 
dementia appeared to be higher among ε4 carriers (compared with ε33: OR, 1.59; 
95% CI, 0.98-2.58; p = 0.06), but lower among ε2 carriers (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 
0.40-1.42; p = 0.38), although neither test was statistically significant. Our 
study suggested that the ApoE ε4 allele may be associated with a lower PD risk 
among non-Hispanic Caucasians.

Patterns and trends in antipsychotic prescribing for Parkinson disease 
psychosis.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic (AP) use is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but APs 
can worsen parkinsonism, evidence for efficacy is limited, and use in patients 
with dementia increases mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency and characteristics, including changes over 
time, of AP use in a large cohort of patients with PD.
DESIGN: Using Veterans Affairs data from fiscal year (FY) 2008, rates and 
predictors of AP prescribing were determined for patients with PD and psychosis 
stratified by dementia status (N = 2597) and a comparison group of patients with 
dementia and psychosis without PD (N = 6907). Fiscal year 2008 and FY2002 data 
were compared to examine changes in AP prescribing over time.
SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient facilities.
PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients with PD and psychosis and outpatients without PD with 
dementia and psychosis, all receiving care at Veterans Affairs facilities in 
FY2002 and FY2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Antipsychotic prescribing, including overall, class, and 
specific medications.
RESULTS: In FY2008, 50% of patients with PD having a diagnosis of psychosis were 
prescribed an AP. Among treated patients, the atypical AP quetiapine was most 
frequently prescribed (66%), but approximately 30% received high-potency APs. 
Clozapine was rarely prescribed (<2%). In multivariate models, diagnoses of PD 
and dementia were associated with AP use. Comparing FY2008 with FY2002, AP use 
in PD was unchanged, with decreases in risperidone and olanzapine use offset by 
an increase in quetiapine prescribing and the introduction of aripiprazole.
CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients with PD and psychosis receive APs, not 
uncommonly high-potency agents associated with worsening parkinsonism, and 
frequency of use has been unchanged since the "black box" warning for AP use in 
patients with dementia was issued. Recent trends are a shift to quetiapine use 
and the common use of aripiprazole. As psychosis and dementia are frequently 
comorbid in PD, safety risks associated with AP use in this population need to 
be assessed.

Evidence for angiogenesis in Parkinson's disease, incidental Lewy body disease, 
and progressive supranuclear palsy.

Angiogenesis has not been extensively studied in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
despite being associated with other neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem 
human brain tissues were obtained from subjects with pathologically confirmed 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rapidly 
progressing Parkinsonian-like disorder. Tissues were also obtained from subjects 
with incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD) who had Lewy bodies in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta (SN(pc)) but had not been diagnosed with PD, and age-matched 
controls without Lewy body pathology. The SNpc, putamen, locus ceruleus (LC) and 
midfrontal cortex were examined for integrin αvβ3, a marker for angiogenesis, 
along with vessel number and activated microglia. All parkinsonian syndromes had 
greater αvβ3 in the LC and the SN(pc), while only PD and PSP subjects had 
elevated αvβ3 in the putamen compared to controls. PD and PSP subjects also had 
increases in microglia number and activation in the SN(pc) suggesting a link 
between inflammation and clinical disease. Microglia activation in iLBD subjects 
was limited to the LC, an area involved at an early stage of PD. Likewise, iLBD 
subjects did not differ from controls in αvβ3 staining in the putamen, a late 
area of involvement in PD. The presence of αvβ3 reactive vessels in PD and its 
syndromes is indicative of newly created vessels that have not likely developed 
the restrictive properties of the blood brain barrier. Such angiogenic vessels 
could contribute to neuroinflammation by failing to protect the parenchyma from 
peripheral immune cells and inflammatory or toxic factors in the peripheral 
circulation.

Emotion recognition impairment in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia.

PURPOSE: Previous research has shown dementia and mild cognitive impairment to 
be present in some Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Nevertheless, it is still 
not clear whether PD patients are also impaired on facial emotion recognition, 
nor it is whether this possible deficit is independent other cognitive 
impairment. The aim of this study is to assess the presence of emotion 
recognition deficits in a sample of PD patients with normal cognitive abilities, 
evaluated with several cognitive tasks widely used to detect cognitive 
impairment in this patient group.
METHOD: 40 non-demented (MMSE scores>25) PD patients and 19 healthy older adults 
matched on demographic characteristics took part in the study. All of them were 
evaluated with a neuropsychological battery including tests aimed to assess the 
cognitive domains mainly affected by PD, as well as a facial emotion recognition 
task.
RESULTS: t-test analysis showed significant differences between PD and control 
groups in 6 cognitive tasks which were introduced in a sequential logistic 
regression analysis. The results confirmed the existence of a facial emotion 
recognition deficit in PD patients after controlling for demographic and 
cognitive characteristics of the participants.
CONCLUSION: Although none of the PD patients fulfilled criteria for dementia, 
many of them appeared to present deficits on recognition of facial emotions. 
This task should therefore be incorporated into future research to study the 
full range of early cognitive dysfunctions and non-motor symptoms presents in PD 
patients, and inclusion of this task in assessment protocols should be 
considered.

Association between essential tremor and other neurodegenerative diseases: what 
is the epidemiological evidence?

Comment in
    Neuroepidemiology. 2011;37(1):11-2.

BACKGROUND: The possible links between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and, more recently, between ET and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have 
been of great interest, particularly with the emergence of postmortem data 
suggesting that ET itself may be a neurodegenerative disease. Given the very 
high population prevalence of ET, its possible role as a risk factor for PD and 
AD is of special significance. At the center of this debate is the burgeoning 
evidence from epidemiological studies, examining whether there is an increased 
co-occurrence of these conditions within the same individuals or within 
families.
METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search from 1966 to March 2011 and reviewed the 
epidemiological evidence, restricting our analyses to studies that generated 
quantifiable measures of association (odds ratios or relative risks), thereby 
being able to assess the role of chance.
RESULTS: The most robust evidence, from case-control, prospective and familial 
aggregation studies, indicates that ET is associated with increased odds and 
increased risks of both PD and AD.
CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable epidemiological evidence to support a link 
between ET and these neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to 
corroborate the current results, provide additional estimates of effect and 
begin to explore the mechanistic underpinnings for these intriguing 
associations.

Recent advances have been made in defining the genetic and molecular basis of 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) and related neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) which comprise 
the spectrum of "Lewy body disorders" (LBDs). The genetic alterations and 
underlying disease mechanisms in the LBD overlap substantially, suggesting 
common disease mechanisms. As with the other neurodegenerative dementias, early 
diagnosis in LBD or even identification prior to symptom onset is key to 
developing effective therapeutic strategies, but this is dependent upon the 
development of robust, specific, and sensitive biomarkers as diagnostic tools 
and therapeutic endpoints. Recently identified mutations in the synucleins and 
other relevant genes in PD and DLB as well as related biomolecular pathways 
suggest candidate markers from biological fluids and imaging modalities that 
reflect the underlying disease mechanisms. In this context, several promising 
biomarkers for the LBD have already been identified and examined, while other 
intriguing possible candidates have recently emerged. Challenges remain in 
defining their correlation with pathological processes and their ability to 
detect DLB and related disorders, and perhaps a combined array of biomarkers may 
be needed to distinguish various LBDs.

Genetic contributors to frontotemporal lobar degeneration: beyond monogenic 
disease.

Brescia, Italy. bborroni@inwind.it

Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) is a genetically and pathologically 
heterogeneous disorder characterized by behavioral change, executive dysfunction 
and language impairment associated with frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. 
Three major clinical subtypes have been identified so far, namely behaviour 
variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Semantic Dementia (SD) and Progressive 
Non-Fluent Aphasia (PNFA). FTLD might also overlap with atypical parkinsonisms 
or motor neuron disease. Several pathogenetic mutations have been associated 
with specific pathological and clinical correlates. FTLD associated with either 
Microtuble Associated Protein Tau (MAPT) or Progranulin (PGRN) mutations is 
recognised as the most common form of autosomal dominant inherited disorder. 
However, monogenic mutations account for only about one third of all FTLD cases. 
Several studies have evaluated the contribution of genetic background in 
non-monogenic forms of FTLD, with the attempt to establish its role in 
increasing disease risk and in modulating clinical phenotypes. Specific MAPT and 
PGRN polymorphisms have been demonstrated to affect disease onset, clinical 
features and prognosis of FTLD, and genetic variations within other genes appear 
to play a role in influencing disease risk and clinical expression of FTLD. The 
aim of the present review is to discuss the impact and the role of genetic 
background in non-monogenic forms of FTLD, to highlight new potential 
pathogenetic and therapeutic targets.

A subtle cognitive impairment can be detected early in the course of Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Executive, memory and visuospatial functions are specifically 
affected, but the underlying pathophysiological basis is not well elucidated yet 
and may be heterogeneous. The recent identification of a PD-related cognitive 
metabolic pattern (PDCP), including hypometabolism in associative frontal, 
parietal and posterior limbic structures, has integrated the classical notion of 
a striato-frontal syndrome at the basis of cognitive dys-function. Recent 
evidence suggests that whilst executive dys-function is seen in virtually all PD 
patients, visuospatial and memory impairment may share a higher risk for the 
subsequent development of dementia. By means of perfusion SPECT and 
[18F]FDG-PET, cortical dys-function may be highlighted since the early stages, 
it is more evident in PD patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 
reaches the maximum in PD dementia (PDD). Posterior temporo-parieto-occipital 
dys-function in associative and limbic cortex, closely resembling that found in 
Alzheimer's disease patients, is found in PDD, with a more severe occipital 
hypometabolism and a relatively milder hypometabolism in medial temporal lobe 
structures. Furthermore, deficit of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) can be found by 
means of [11C]MP4A-PET already in early stage of PD, especially in posterior 
regions, then becoming more severe in PDD and in dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB). Administration of AchE inhibitors to PDD patients increased brain 
metabolism in bilateral frontal and left parietal regions, and left posterior 
cingulate. Finally, the recent availability of radiopharmaceuticals able to 
disclose amyloid brain deposition has allowed to demonstrate amyloid load in a 
part of patients with PDD, possibly due to diffuse rather than neuritic plaques. 
Brain PET and SPECT have strongly contributed to the understanding of the 
pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD and may serve as probes to monitor 
the effects of therapeutic interventions.

Decreased BMI has been reported that it may be associated with cognitive decline 
in the elderly. Weight loss is common in patients with PD. However, studies 
comparing cognitive changes according to BMI changes in PD have not been done 
yet. We performed this study to know a relationship between BMI changes and the 
rate of cognitive decline in PD. PD patients were recruited retrospectively. The 
patients (n=104) were divided into two groups according to BMI changes during 
initial 6 months of follow-up: decreased (n=52) vs. stable BMI groups (n=52). 
Cognitive functions were repeated until 36 months of follow-up using the Korean 
version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the modified 
Mini-Mental State (3MS) test. We calculated the rate of cognitive decline 
(K-MMSE and 3MS score changes/month) and compared it between the two groups. The 
decreased BMI group showed lower level of cognitive function than that of stable 
BMI group, especially at the 36th month of follow-up (p<0.05). In addition, the 
rate of cognitive decline was also significantly faster in the decreased BMI 
group, particularly at the 36th month of follow-up (p<0.05). This study suggests 
that decreased BMI during initial 6 months of follow-up in PD might be a useful 
indicator for future risk of dementia and let clinicians predict faster rate of 
cognitive decline in patients with PD.

Clínic, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

Dementia is a frequent and devastating non-motor complication of advanced 
Parkinson's disease (PD). There is growing evidence of a synergistic role of 
Alzheimer's-type brain lesions containing τ and amyloid-β (Aβ) proteins and 
cortical Lewy aggregates in PD-related dementia (PDD). Therefore, biomarkers of 
both τ and Aβ may be seen as diagnostic and predictive markers of PDD. Here, we 
review the available studies in PD and PDD using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total 
τ, phospho-τ, and/or Aβ levels, and PET probes targeting Alzheimer's-type 
lesions. Overall, high CSF τ and phospho-τ levels and/or low CSF Aβ levels have 
been found in part of PDD patients, and a longitudinal study has found greater 
worsening in cognitive performance over time in non-demented PD patients with 
low baseline CSF Aβ levels. Few studies are available on the use of PET imaging 
in PD, all of them using the Pittsburgh B compound (PIB), and with figures of 
about 30% of scans with PIB uptake in the AD-range in PDD. We conclude that 
these CSF and PET markers deserve further evaluation as candidate biomarkers of 
dementia in PD. According to this, we are currently undertaking a longitudinal 
project on the predictive value of dementia of the combined use of CSF τ and Aβ 
and (18)F-FDDNP PET in PD.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms caused by Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are often underestimated in routine clinical practice, partly due 
to the lack of short screening tests. The "Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia 
Assessment" (PANDA) is a new convenient tool, validated in German, to assess 
cognition in PD. It consists of five cognitive tasks and a brief mood 
questionnaire, and is designed for the early detection of mild cognitive 
deficits as well as dementia.
AIMS: To translate the PANDA into French and provide normative data for a French 
speaking population.
METHODS: The translation was made by means of the translation/re-translation 
method. The normation was conducted with 61 control subjects (CS). The Mini 
Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered concurrently. A comparison was 
made with the original study's control group (CG) to determine whether the 
German algorithms for converting the raw scores could also be used with the 
French version or whether a new procedure had to be developed. All statistics 
were conducted with SPSS Statistics18.
RESULTS: There is a significant correlation between the PANDA total score and 
MMSE (r=0.42, p=0.001). Analysis of the total converted scores shows no 
significant correlation with age (r=-0.19; p=0.14). After correction for 
education, there is no significant difference between our CS and the original 
study's CG (t=1.50; p=0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PANDA French translation can be used 
with the same transformation algorithms as the German version, when adding a 
correction for education.

Movement kinematic variables related to force production can be modulated to 
respond appropriately to different contexts. We previously showed that in a 
choice-reaction time and a predictable timed-response task, normal subjects 
perform reaching movements to the same targets with two different kinematic 
patterns, a marker of flexibility. Here, we used the two tasks to determine 
whether basal ganglia are involved in the selection and modulation of movement 
kinematics and therefore in flexible force production. We tested seventeen 
patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, eleven pre-symptomatic 
Huntington's disease carriers and sixteen age-matched normal controls with the 
above-mentioned motor tasks. In both patient groups, the difference in 
kinematics (movement duration, peak velocity and acceleration) between the two 
tasks was significantly reduced compared to controls, indicating a limited range 
of choices or flexibility. However, this reduction was skewed in opposite 
directions in the two disorders, with force production being generally higher in 
Huntington's carriers and lower in Parkinson's patients compared to controls. We 
conclude that basal ganglia are involved in adapting movement to different 
contexts and selecting the appropriate movement force. The opposite trends in 
Parkinson's and Huntington's disease suggest that such regulation might depend 
on the balance between the outputs of direct and indirect pathways.

Does vigorous exercise have a neuroprotective effect in Parkinson disease?

Ahlskog JE(1).

(1)Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. 
eahlskog@mayo.edu

Parkinson disease (PD) is progressive, with dementia and medication-refractory 
motor problems common reasons for late-stage nursing-home placement. Increasing 
evidence suggests that ongoing vigorous exercise/physical fitness may favorably 
influence this progression. Parkinsonian animal models reveal exercise-related 
protection from dopaminergic neurotoxins, apparently mediated by brain 
neurotrophic factors and neuroplasticity (predicted from in vitro studies). 
Similarly, exercise consistently improves cognition in animals, also linked to 
enhanced neuroplasticity and increased neurotrophic factor expression. In these 
animal models, immobilization has the opposite effect. Brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may mediate at least some of this exercise benefit. 
In humans, exercise increases serum BDNF, and this is known to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. PD risk in humans is significantly reduced by midlife 
exercise, documented in large prospective studies. No studies have addressed 
whether exercise influences dementia risk in PD, but exercised patients with PD 
improve cognitive scores. Among seniors in general, exercise or physical fitness 
has not only been associated with better cognitive scores, but midlife exercise 
significantly reduces the later risk of both dementia and mild cognitive 
impairment. Finally, numerous studies in seniors with and without dementia have 
reported increased cerebral gray matter volumes associated with physical fitness 
or exercise. These findings have several implications for PD clinicians. (1) 
Ongoing vigorous exercise and physical fitness should be highly encouraged. (2) 
PD physical therapy programs should include structured, graduated fitness 
instruction and guidance for deconditioned patients with PD. (3) Levodopa and 
other forms of dopamine replenishment therapy should be utilized to achieve the 
maximum capability and motivation for patients to maintain fitness.

Dopamine-depletion and increased α-synuclein load induce degeneration of 
cortical cholinergic fibers in mice.

Cognitive dysfunction can be common among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 
multiplication of the gene α-synuclein (αsyn) increases the risk of dementia. 
Here, we studied the role of dopamine-depletion and increased αsyn load and 
aggregation on cholinergic structures in vivo. Wild-type (WT) and mice with A30P 
αsyn overexpression were treated subacutely with 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and the number of 
cholinergic cells in their nucleus basalis magnocellularis-substantia innominata 
(NBM-SI), their cortical fiber density and their expression of different genes 
1day or 90 days after the last MPTP-injection were measured. Long-term dopamine 
depletion decreased the expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) in the 
NBM-SI of WT mice, but no neuron loss was observed. In contrast, cortical 
cholinergic fiber density was decreased three months after MPTP-injection. 
Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression could maintain 
cholinergic functions under these conditions. Expression of A30P αsyn in 
six-months-old transgenic mice resulted in decreased tyrosine receptor kinase B 
expression, and lower cortical cholinergic fiber density. Dopamine-depletion by 
MPTP induced cholinergic cell loss in the NBM-SI and increased cortical fiber 
loss. Our findings may explain why cholinergic cells are more vulnerable in PD, 
leading to an increased probability of dementia.

Considering the many differences between mice and humans, it is perhaps 
surprising how well mice model late-onset human neurodegenerative disease. 
Models of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease and 
Huntington's disease show some striking similarities to the corresponding human 
pathologies in terms of axonal transport disruption, protein aggregation, 
synapse loss and some behavioural phenotypes. However, there are also major 
differences. To extrapolate from mouse models to human disease, we need to 
understand how these differences relate to intrinsic limitations of the mouse 
system and to the effects of transgene overexpression. In the present paper, we 
use examples from an amyloid-overexpression model and a mutant-tau-knockin model 
to illustrate what we learn from each type of approach and what the limitations 
are. Finally, we discuss the further contributions that knockin and similar 
approaches can make to understanding pathogenesis and how best to model 
disorders of aging in a short-lived mammal.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar 
ataxias, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease, manifest in adult age with 
insidiously developing, slowly progressing symptoms. At this stage, most 
patients consult a doctor, and a definite diagnosis can be made. It is, however, 
well established that the manifest disease is preceded by a presymptomatic 
disease stage that may last for years. A striking example is Parkinson's 
disease, in which more than half of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia 
nigra are lost before motor symptoms appear. Studies of the presymptomatic stage 
of neurodegenerative disorders are pivotal for an advanced understanding of 
these disorders and the development of preventive strategies aimed at postponing 
the clinical onset of these disorders. It is therefore important to identify the 
earliest and most sensitive clinical signs and biological markers that herald 
the onset of the illness. Furthermore, studies of presymptomatic disease stages 
are important because they may help to unravel compensatory mechanisms 
responsible for apparently normal brain function despite ongoing 
neurodegeneration.
